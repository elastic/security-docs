[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
|Rule |Description |Status |Version

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-3-potential-non-standard-port-ssh-connection, Potential Non-Standard Port SSH connection>> | Identifies potentially malicious processes communicating via a port paring typically not associated with SSH. For example, SSH over port 2200 or port 2222 as opposed to the traditional port 22. Adversaries may make changes to the standard port a protocol uses to bypass filtering or muddle analysis/parsing of network data. | new | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-3-masquerading-space-after-filename, Masquerading Space After Filename>> | This rules identifies a process created from an executable with a space appended to the end of the filename. This may indicate an attempt to masquerade a malicious file as benign to gain user execution. When a space is added to the end of certain files, the OS will execute the file according to it's true filetype instead of it's extension. Adversaries can hide a program's true filetype by changing the extension of the file. They can then add a space to the end of the name so that the OS automatically executes the file when it's double-clicked. | new | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-3-multiple-alerts-in-different-att-ck-tactics-on-a-single-host, Multiple Alerts in Different ATT&CK Tactics on a Single Host>> | This rule uses alert data to determine when multiple alerts in different phases of an attack involving the same host are triggered.

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-3-adminsdholder-sdprop-exclusion-added, AdminSDHolder SDProp Exclusion Added>> | Identifies a modification on the dsHeuristics attribute on the bit that holds the configuration of groups excluded from the SDProp process. The SDProp compares the permissions on protected objects with those defined on the AdminSDHolder object. If the permissions on any of the protected accounts and groups do not match, the permissions on the protected accounts and groups are reset to match those of the domain's AdminSDHolder object, meaning that groups excluded will remain unchanged. Attackers can abuse this misconfiguration to maintain long-term access to privileged accounts in these groups. | update | 103 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-3-unusual-persistence-via-services-registry, Unusual Persistence via Services Registry>> | Identifies processes modifying the services registry key directly, instead of through the expected Windows APIs.
