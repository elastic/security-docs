[[features-7.14.0]]
==== Features
* Host isolation allows analysts to isolate hosts from their networks while investigating a potential attack. Analysts can use this feature to respond to malicious activity by containing infected hosts, curbing potential attacks, and preventing lateral movement to other hosts. This feature is supported on Windows and macOS.
* Adds malware protection for Linux endpoints. Users can enable Linux malware protection in their policy to receive detection alerts ({pull}103404[#103404])({pull}95014[#95014])({pull}104984[#104984]).
* Adds threat intelligence to alerts ({pull}101553[#101553])({pull}103383[#103383]).
* Introduces the Swimlane connector for rules and cases ({pull}100086[#100086]).
* Introduces role-based access control for cases and allows users to be given all, write, or no access to cases ({pull}95058[#95058]).
* Adds new functionality and usability improvements to the Osquery Manager integration:
** Users can create and curate a library of saved queries.
** When running a live query, users can select a saved query or create a new one.
** Scheduled queries can be constrained to a particular OS or osquery version.
** Users can view who ran or scheduled a query, which is helpful during auditing.
** The agent list for live queries only shows enrolled agents to make selecting targets easier.
* Enhances alert documents to have the fields of `constant_keyword`, runtime fields, aliases, and `copy_to` ({pull}102280[#102280]).

[[known-issue-7.14.0]]
==== Known issues
* The {agent} must be upgraded to the newest version to use the Osquery Manager integration in 7.14.0. Upgrade instructions are available at {fleet-guide}/upgrade-elastic-agent.html[Upgrade {agent}] ({pull}26545[#26545]).
* Customized event rendering settings do not persist on the Alerts page ({pull}106819[#106819]).
* Fields that have been added to the Alerts table donâ€™t display in the table, but do in the alert details ({pull}106840[#106840]).
* After upgrading from 7.8 to 7.14, rules sometimes fail to execute, activate, or deactivate. To resolve this, use the <<rules-api-update, PATCH rule API>> to update each rule that encounters this problem. The payload of the PATCH call should set the `author` field to `[]`, as shown in the example below. After the `author` field is populated, the rule works as expected ({pull}106233[#106233]).

[[known-issue-7.13.2]]
==== Known issue
The following {ml-cap} rules contain incorrectly configured ML job IDs (underscores were used instead of dashes between words) and cannot be successfully activated after they are enabled. Running these rules will cause an error message to display, indicating that an error occurred during the rule's execution. This issue is present in {stack} 7.13, 7.13.1, and 7.13.2. ({issue}102146[#102146])

* `high-count-by-destination-country`
* `high-count-network-denies`
* `high-count-network-events`
* `rare-destination-country`

To ensure these rules can successfully run, duplicate the rule and edit it using these steps:

. Go to the Detections page and select **Manage detection rules**.
. Filter the Rules table to only display rules with the `ML` tag and search for the ML rule you want to duplicate.
. Select the rule you want to duplicate and click **Bulk actions -> Duplicate selected**.
. Select the duplicated rule and click **Edit rule settings**.
. From the *Definition* tab, enter the correct ML job ID. For example, to fix the incorrectly configured `high_count_by_destination_country` ML rule job ID, remove the current job ID and enter `high-count-by-destination-country`. Click **Save changes** after you've finished.
. Delete the prebuilt ML job.

The `/api/lists` `DELETE` API has been updated to check for references before removing the specified resource(s) from value lists and will now return a 409 conflict if any references exist. Set the new `ignoreReferences` query param to `true` to maintain the behavior of deleting value list(s) without performing any additional checks.

[[upgrade-notes-7.10]]
==== Post upgrade requirements

When upgrading the {stack} to version 7.10.0 from a previous minor version (7.9.x),
perform the following:

* Grant `view_index_metadata` https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/detections-permissions-section.html#enable-detections-ui[permissions] to any Elastic Security users. This is required to enable **event correlation** rules. Other previously activated detection rules will continue to run after upgrade.

[discrete]
[[breaking-changes-7.10.0]]
==== Breaking changes

*Signals template updated for rollover indices*

The `create_index_route` now checks if the template needs to be upgraded
before creating the index. If the index already exists and the template was upgraded,
the index rolls over so that the write index has the upgraded mapping.
This breaks the old mappings that have `risk_score mapped` as a keyword.
In the new mapping, `signal.rule.risk_score` is a float.  After rolling over,
there is a conflict between the old and new `signal.rule.risk_score` for some
features, such as aggregations.

This requires the `view_index_metadata` permission in Kibana. See ({pull}/80019[#80019]) for details.

*Connect incident fields allowed when cases are sent*

You can now specify connector incident fields when cases are sent. This includes:
* Jira: issue type, priority, and parent issue in the case of a subtask.
* IBM Resilient: issue types, and severity.
* ServiceNow: urgency, severity, and impact.
