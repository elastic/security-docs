[[breaking-changes-7.11.0]]
==== Breaking changes

*Referential integrity issues when deleting value lists*

The `/api/lists` `DELETE` API has been updated to check for references before removing the specified resource(s) from value lists and will now return a 409 conflict if any references exist. Set the new `ignoreReferences` query param to `true` to maintain the behavior of deleting value list(s) without performing any additional checks.

[[known-issues-7.11.0]]
==== Known issues

* The Elastic Endpoint Security rule will report a failure status until the Endpoint sends an alert for the first time. At that point, the next rule execution will succeed.  `logs-endpoint.alerts-*` index pattern does not get created until the Endpoint sends the first alert ({issue}90401[#90401]).

* In the Alert Details Summary view, values for some fields appear truncated. You'll only be able to see the first character ({issue}90539[#90539]).

[[upgrade-notes-7.10]]
==== Post upgrade requirements

When upgrading the {stack} to version 7.10.0 from a previous minor version (7.9.x), 
perform the following:

* Grant `view_index_metadata` https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/detections-permissions-section.html#enable-detections-ui[permissions] to any Elastic Security users. This is required to enable **event correlation** rules. Other previously activated detection rules will continue to run after upgrade.

[discrete]
[[breaking-changes-7.10.0]]
==== Breaking changes

*Signals template updated for rollover indices*

The `create_index_route` now checks if the template needs to be upgraded
before creating the index. If the index already exists and the template was upgraded,
the index rolls over so that the write index has the upgraded mapping.
This breaks the old mappings that have `risk_score mapped` as a keyword.
In the new mapping, `signal.rule.risk_score` is a float.  After rolling over,
there is a conflict between the old and new `signal.rule.risk_score` for some
features, such as aggregations.

This requires the `view_index_metadata` permission in Kibana. See ({pull}/80019[#80019]) for details.

*Connect incident fields allowed when cases are sent*

You can now specify connector incident fields when cases are sent. This includes:
* Jira: issue type, priority, and parent issue in the case of a subtask.
* IBM Resilient: issue types, and severity.
* ServiceNow: urgency, severity, and impact.

See ({pull}77327[#77327]) for details.

[[upgrade-notes-7.9.1]]
==== Post upgrade requirements

After upgrading the {stack} to version 7.9.0 and 7.9.1 from a previous minor
release (7.8.x, 7.7.x, and so on), you need to:

* <<enable-detections-ui, Enable access to the Detections page>>. Previously
activated detection rules continue to run after upgrading, and this is only
required to enable the UI.
* <<post-upgrade-req, Enable the process analyzer>>. This is only required if you want to view
<<alerts-analyze-events, graphical representations of process relationships>>.

* Fixes issues when exceptions are no longer associated with a rule
({pull}76012[#76012]).
* Prevents adding exceptions to unsupported rule types ({pull}75802[#75802]).

({pull}74582[#74582]).

==== Breaking changes

*Actions API*

When you <<register-connector, create a {sn} connector>> via the Actions API:

* The `casesConfiguration` object is obsolete. Instead, use
`incidentConfiguration`.
* To see {sn} connectors in the UI, you must use the `isCaseOwned` field.

IMPORTANT: These changes only apply to {sn} connectors.

[[known-issues-7.9.0]]

as selected in the UI ({issue}75194[#75194]).
* When creating rules, if you have more than one Timeline template the template
