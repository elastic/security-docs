[[upgrade-notes]]
== Post upgrade requirements

After upgrading the {stack} to version 7.9.0 and 7.9.1 from a previous minor
release (7.8.x, 7.7.x, and so on), you need to:

* <<enable-detections-ui, Enable access to the Detections page>>. Previously
activated detection rules continue to run after upgrading, and this is only
required to enable the UI.
* <<post-upgrade-req, Enable the process analyzer>>. This is only required if you want to view
<<alerts-analyze-events, graphical representations of process relationships>>.

[[breaking-changes-7.10.0]]
==== Breaking changes

*Signals template updated for rollover indices*

The `create_index_route` now checks if the template needs to be upgraded
before creating the index. If the index already exists and the template was upgraded,
the index rolls over so that the write index has the upgraded mapping.
This breaks the old mappings that have `risk_score mapped` as a keyword.
In the new mapping, `signal.rule.risk_score` is a float.  After rolling over,
there is a conflict between the old and new `signal.rule.risk_score` for some
features, such as aggregations.

See ({pull}/80019[#80019]) for details.

*Connect incident fields allowed when cases are sent*

You can now specify connector incident fields when cases are sent. This includes:
* Jira: issue type, priority, and parent issue in the case of a subtask.
* IBM Resilient: issue types, and severity.
* ServiceNow: urgency, severity, and impact.

See ({pull}77327[#77327]) for details.
