[[upgrade-notes]]
== Post upgrade requirements

After upgrading the {stack} to version 7.9.0 and 7.9.1 from a previous minor
release (7.8.x, 7.7.x, and so on), you need to:

* <<enable-detections-ui, Enable access to the Detections page>>. Previously
activated detection rules continue to run after upgrading, and this is only
required to enable the UI.
* <<post-upgrade-req, Enable the process analyzer>>. This is only required if you want to view
<<alerts-analyze-events, graphical representations of process relationships>>.
