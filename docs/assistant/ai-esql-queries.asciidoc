This page describes some of the ways Elastic AI Assistant can help you leverage the Elasticsearch Query Language, {esql}. 

With AI Assistant's {esql} knowledge base enabled, it benefits from specialized training data that enables it to answer questions related to {esql} at an expert level. 

IMPORTANT: To enable AI Assistant's {esql} query capabilities, follow the <<ai-assistant-knowledge-base, setup instructions>>. 

AI Assistant can help with {esql} in many ways, including:

* **Education and training**: AI Assistant can serve as a powerful {esql} learning tool. Ask it for examples, explanations of complex queries, and best practices.
* **Writing new queries**: Prompt AI Assistant to provide a query that accomplishes a particular task, and it will generate a query matching your description. For example: `Write a query to identify documents with curl.exe usage and calculate the sum of destination.bytes` or `What query would return all user logins to [a host] in the last six hours?`
* **Providing feedback on existing queries**: To prompt AI Assistant to make changes to, refactor, or assess an existing query, provide it with the query you want to work on and ask it for improvements.
* **Optimizing query performance**: AI Assistant can help optimize query performance to support the analysis of large data sets.
* **Customizing queries for your environment**: Since each environment is unique, you may need to customize queries from other contexts. AI Assistant can suggest necessary modifications based on contextual information you provide. 
* **Troubleshooting**: Having trouble with a query or getting unexpected results? Ask AI Assistant to help you troubleshoot.

In these ways and others, AI Assistant can enable you to make use of {esql}'s advanced search capabilities to accomplish goals across {elastic-sec}.
