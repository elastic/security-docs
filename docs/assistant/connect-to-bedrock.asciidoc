= Connect to Amazon Bedrock

This page provides step-by-step instructions for setting up an Amazon Bedrock connector for the first time. This connector type enables you to leverage large language models (LLMs) within {kib}. You'll first need to configure AWS, then configure the connector in {kib}.

NOTE: Only Amazon Bedrock's `Anthropic` models are supported: `Claude` and `Claude instant`.

== Configure AWS

[discrete]
=== Configure an IAM policy 

. Log into the AWS console and search for Identity and Access Management (IAM).
. From the **IAM** menu, select **Policies** → **Create policy**.
. To provide the necessary permissions, paste the following JSON into the **Specify permissions** menu.
+
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "bedrock:InvokeModel",
                "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
+
NOTE: These are the minimum required permissions. IAM policies with additional permissions are also supported.
+
. Click **Next**. Name your policy.

=== Configure an IAM User

. Return to the **IAM** menu. Select **Users** from the navigation menu, then click **Create User**. 
. Name the user, then click **Next**.
. Select **Attach policies directly**. 
. In the **Permissions policies** field, search for the policy you created earlier, select it, and click **Next**.
. Review the configuration then click **Create user**.

=== Create an access key

. Return to the **IAM** menu. Select **Users** from the navigation menu. 
. Search for the user you just created, and click its name.
. Go to the **Security credentials** tab.
. Under **Access keys**, click **Create access key**.
. Select **Third-party service**, check the box under **Confirmation**, click **Next**, then click **Create access key**.
. Click **Download .csv file** to download the key. Store it securely.

=== Enable model access

. Search the AWS console for Amazon Bedrock. 
. From the Amazon Bedrock page, click **Get started**.
. Select **Model access** from the left navigation menu, then click **Manage model access**.
. Check the boxes for **Claude** and **Claude Instant**, depending which model or models you plan to use.
. Click **Save changes**.

[discrete]
== Configure Elastic AI Assistant

. Log in to {kib}. 
. Go to **Stack Management → Connectors → Create connector → Amazon Bedrock**. 
. Name your connector. 
. (Optional) Configure the Amazon Bedrock connector to use a different AWS region where Anthropic models are supported by editing the **URL** field, for example by changing `us-east-1` to `eu-central-1`.
. (Optional) Add one of the following strings if you want to use a model other than the default:
.. For Haiku: `anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0`
.. For Sonnet: `anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0`
.. For Opus: `anthropic.claude-3-opus-20240229-v1:0`
. Enter the **Access Key** and **Secret** that you generated earlier, then click **Save**.

Your model is now configured. For more information on using Elastic AI Assistant, refer to <<security-assistant, AI Assistant>>.

IMPORTANT: If you're using provisioned throughput, your ARN becomes the model ID, and the connector settings **URL** value must be https://www.urlencoder.org/[encoded] to work. 
+
For example, if the non-encoded ARN is: `arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-2:123456789102:provisioned-model/3Ztr7hbzmkrqy1`
+
The encoded ARN would be: `arn%3Aaws%3Abedrock%3Aus-east-2%3A123456789102%3Aprovisioned-model%2F3Ztr7hbzmkrqy1`
