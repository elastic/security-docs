The Elastic AI Assistant utilizes generative AI to bolster your cybersecurity operations team. It allows users to interact with {elastic-sec} for tasks such as alert investigation, incident response, and query generation or conversion using natural language and much more.

A connector for OpenAI and Azure OpenAI Service powers the AI Assistant.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This is an initial release of the Elastic AI Assistant. While designed to enhance your analysis with smart dialogues, its capabilities are still developing. Users should leverage it sensibly as the reliability of its responses might vary. Your insights, patience, and feedback help us calibrate this feature for optimal use. Always cross-verify any returned advice for accurate threat detection and response, insights, and query generation.

[[data-information]]
== Your data and the AI Assistant

Elastic does not store or examine prompts sent to or results generated by the AI Assistant, nor does Elastic use the data for any future training or context. This includes any data used in conversations for analysis or context, such as alert or event data, detection rule configurations, and queries. This data is sent to and processed by the third-party provider that you choose when setting up the Generative AI connector, as part of the assistant setup.

Elastic does not have any control over the third-party tools, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content, operation, or use, nor for any loss or damage that may arise from your using such tools. Please exercise caution when using AI tools with personal, sensitive, or confidential information. Any data you submit may be used by the provider for AI training or other purposes. There is no guarantee that the provider will keep any information you provide secure or confidential. You should familiarize yourself with the privacy practices and terms of use of any generative AI tools prior to use.

[[set-up-ai-assistant]]
== Set up the AI Assistant

You must complete these steps before you can use the AI Assistant:

. Create an API key with your AI provider to authenticate requests from the AI Assistant. You'll use this in the next step. Refer to the provider's documentation for generating API keys:
+
* https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference[OpenAI]
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/reference[Azure OpenAI Service]

. Create a {kibana-ref}/gen-ai-action-type.html[Generative AI connector] using the AI provider's API key and URL to configure communication between {elastic-sec} and the provider. You can do this in {kib} from *Stack Management* -> *Connectors*, or from within the AI Assistant.

[[start-chatting]]
== Start chatting

To open the AI Assistant, press *Cmd + ;* (or *Ctrl + ;* in Windows) from anywhere in the {security-app}. This opens the *Welcome* chat interface, where you can ask general questions about {elastic-sec}.

You can also chat with the AI Assistant from several areas in {elastic-sec}, and context-specific data and prompts will populate your conversation.

* <<view-alert-details, Alert details>> or Event details flyout: Click *Chat* while viewing the details of an alert or event.
* <<rules-ui-management, Rules page>>: Select one or more rules, then click the magic wand icon (ðŸª„âœ¨) at the top of the page next to the *Rules* title.
* <<data-quality-dash, Data Quality dashboard>>: Select the *Incompatible fields* tab, then click *Chat*. (This is only available for fields marked red, indicating they're incompatible).
* <<timelines-ui, Timeline>>: Select the *Security Assistant* tab.

NOTE: All chat history and custom quick prompts persist in local browser storage, allowing you to navigate away to other areas in {elastic-sec}, then return to ongoing conversations. This also means that chats persist across multiple users if they use the same browser; be sure clear any chats that you don't want available to other users.

[[interact-with-assistant]]
== Interact with the AI Assistant

Use these features to adjust and act on your conversations with the AI Assistant:

* Select a _system prompt_ at the beginning of a conversation to establish how detailed and technical you want the AI Assistant's answers to be.

+
NOTE: The system prompt is only configurable at the start of a conversation. To reconfigure it, clear the chat and start a new conversation.

* Select a _quick prompt_ at the bottom of the chat window to get help writing a prompt for a specific purpose, such as summarizing an alert or converting a query from a legacy SIEM to {elastic-sec}. Available quick prompts vary based on context. You can also add custom quick prompts for questions you frequently ask the AI Assistant.

* Use these buttons to perform actions in the conversation history and prompt entry area:

** *Add note to timeline* (image:images/icon-add-note.png[Add note icon,16,16]): Create a note in Timeline using the selected text.
** *Add to existing case* (image:images/icon-add-to-case.png[Add to case icon,19,16]): Add a comment to an existing case using the selected text.
** *Copy to clipboard* (image:images/icon-copy.png[Copy to clipboard icon,17,18]): Copy the text to clipboard to paste elsewhere. This is also helpful for resubmitting a previous prompt.
** *Add to timeline* (image:images/icon-add-to-timeline.png[Copy to clipboard icon,17,18]): Add a filter or query to Timeline using the text. This button appears for certain queries in the AI Assistant's responses. 
+

** *Clear chat* (image:images/icon-clear-red.png[Red X icon,16,16]): Delete the conversation history and start a new chat.
