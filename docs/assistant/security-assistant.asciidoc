The Elastic Security Assistant utilizes generative AI to bolster your cybersecurity operations team. It allows users to interact with {elastic-sec} for tasks such as alert investigation, incident response, and query generation or conversion using natural language and much more.

A connector for OpenAI and Azure OpenAI Service powers the Security Assistant.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This is an initial release of the Elastic Security Assistant. While designed to enhance your analysis with smart dialogues, its capabilities are still developing. Users should leverage it sensibly as the reliability of its responses might vary. Your insights, patience, and feedback help us calibrate this feature for optimal use. Always cross-verify any returned advice for accurate threat detection and response, insights, and query generation.

Also, the data you provide to the Security Assistant is _not_ anonymized, and is stored and processed by the third-party AI provider. This includes any data used in conversations for analysis or context, such as alert or event data, detection rule configurations, and queries. Therefore, be careful about sharing any confidential or sensitive details while using this feature.

[[set-up-ai-assistant]]
== Set up the Security Assistant

You must complete these steps before you can use the Security Assistant:

. Create an API key with your AI provider to authenticate requests from the Security Assistant. You'll use this in a later step. Refer to the provider's documentation for generating API keys:
+
* https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference[OpenAI]
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/reference[Azure OpenAI Service]

. Add the following feature flag to {kib}'s configuration settings:
+
`xpack.securitySolution.enableExperimental: ['assistantEnabled']` 
+
The configuration method depends on your deployment type:
+
* *Self-managed (on-premises) deployments*: Add the feature flag to the `kibana.yml` file, which is used to {kibana-ref}/settings.html[configure {kib}], then restart {kib}.
* *{ecloud} deployments*: Use the YAML editor in the {ecloud} console to add the feature flag to {cloud}/ec-manage-kibana-settings.html[{kib} user settings].

. Create a {kibana-ref}/gen-ai-action-type.html[Generative AI connector] using the AI provider's API key and URL to configure communication between {elastic-sec} and the provider. You can do this in {kib} from *Stack Management* -> *Connectors*, or from within the Security Assistant.
+
NOTE: The Generative AI connector type requires the `assistantEnabled` feature flag for use.

[[start-chatting]]
== Start chatting

To open the Security Assistant, press *Cmd + ;* (or *Ctrl + ;* in Windows) from anywhere in the {security-app}. This opens the *Welcome* chat interface, where you can ask general questions about {elastic-sec}.

You can also chat with the Security Assistant from several areas in {elastic-sec}, and context-specific data and prompts will populate your conversation.

* <<view-alert-details, Alert details>> or Event details flyout: Click *Chat* while viewing the details of an alert or event.
* <<rules-ui-management, Rules page>>: Select one or more rules, then click the magic wand icon (🪄✨) at the top of the page next to the *Rules* title.
* <<data-quality-dash, Data Quality dashboard>>: Select the *Incompatible fields* tab, then click *Chat*. (This is only available for fields marked red, indicating they're incompatible).
* <<timelines-ui, Timeline>>: Select the *Security Assistant* tab.

All chat history persists within your session, so you can navigate away to other areas of {elastic-sec}, then later return to ongoing conversations.

NOTE: The system prompt is only configurable at the start of a conversation. To reconfigure it, clear the chat and start a new conversation.

* Select a _quick prompt_ at the bottom of the chat window to get help writing a prompt for a specific purpose, such as summarizing an alert or converting a query from a legacy SIEM to {elastic-sec}. Available quick prompts vary based on context. You can also add custom quick prompts for questions you frequently ask the Security Assistant.
