= Connect to OpenAI

This page provides step-by-step instructions for setting up an OpenAI connector for the first time. This connector type enables you to leverage OpenAI's large language models (LLMs) within {kib}. You'll first need to create an OpenAI API key, then configure the connector in {kib}.

== Configure OpenAI

[discrete]
=== Select a model

Before creating an API key, you must choose a model. Refer to the https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4[OpenAI docs] to select a model. Take note of the specific model name (for example `gpt-4-turbo`); you'll need it when configuring {kib}.

NOTE: `GPT-4o` offers increased performance over previous versions. For more information on how different models perform for different tasks, refer to the <<llm-performance-matrix>>.

=== Create an API key

To generate an API key:

. Log in to the OpenAI platform and navigate to **API keys**.
. Select **Create new secret key**.
. Name your key, select an OpenAI project, and set the desired permissions.
. Click **Create secret key** and then copy and securely store the key. It will not be accessible after you leave this screen.

The following video demonstrates these steps.

== Configure the OpenAI connector

To integrate with {kib}:

. Log in to {kib}.
. Navigate to **Stack Management → Connectors → Create Connector → OpenAI**.
. Provide a name for your connector, such as `OpenAI (GPT-4 Turbo Preview)`, to help keep track of the model and version you are using.
. Under **Select an OpenAI provider**, choose **OpenAI**.
. The **URL** field can be left as default.
. Under **Default model**, specify which https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4[model] you want to use.
. Paste the API key that you created into the corresponding field.
. Click **Save**.
