== Use Attack discovery to identify threats
Attack discovery can detect a wide range of threats by finding relationships among alerts that may indicate a coordinated attack. This enables you to comprehend how threats move through and affect your systems. Attack discovery generates detailed overviews of potential threats, which can serve as foundations for further analysis. Learn how to <<attack-discovery,get started with Attack discovery>>.

In the screenshot above, Attack discovery found connections between eleven alerts, and used them to identify and describe an attack chain.

After Attack discovery outlines your threat landscape, Elastic AI Assistant can help you quickly analyze a threat in detail.

== Use AI Assistant to analyze a threat

From a discovery on the Attack discovery page, you can click **View in AI Assistant** to start a chat that includes the discovery as context. 

AI Assistant can quickly compile and present key data and provide suggestions to help you generate an incident report and plan an effective response. You can prompt it to supply relevant data or suggestions with questions like “How can I remediate this threat?” or “What ES|QL query would isolate actions taken by this user?”

The screenshot above shows an {esql} query generated by AI Assistant in response to a user prompt. Learn more about <<esql-queries-assistant,using AI Assistant for {esql}>>.

At any point in a conversation with AI Assistant, you can add data, narrative summaries, and other information from its responses to {elastic-sec}'s case management system to help quickly generate incident reports.

== Create a case using AI Assistant

From the AI Assistant dialogue, click **Add to case** (image:images/icon-add-to-case.png[Add to case icon,19,16]) next to a message to add the information in that message to a case. If you add a message with an Attack discovery to a case, AI Assistant automatically adds the attack summary and all associated alerts to the case. You can also add AI Assistant messages containing remediation steps and relevant data to the case. 

Cases help centralize relevant details in one place for easy sharing with stakeholders. Learn more about <<cases-overview,Cases>>.

[[use-case-incident-reporting-translate]]
== Translate incident information to a different human language using AI Assistant
AI Assistant can translate its findings into other human languages, helping to enable collaboration within global security teams and distributed Security Operations Centers (SOCs), and making it easier to operate in multilingual organizations. 

After AI Assistant provides information in one language, you can ask it to translate its responses. For example, if it provides remediation steps for an incident, you can instruct it to “Translate these remediation steps into Japanese.” You can then add the translated output to a case. This can help team members receive the same information and insights regardless of their primary language.

In our internal testing, AI Assistant translations preserved the accuracy and utility of the original content.
