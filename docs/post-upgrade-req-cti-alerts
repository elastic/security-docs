= Migrate detection alerts enriched with threat intelligence

After upgrading to {stack} version 7.15.x from a previous minor release (e.g., 7.14.x, etc.), you need to migrate detection alerts enriched with threat intelligence to ensure threat intelligence properly displays in {elastic-sec}.

To migrate detection alerts:

. <<deactivate-detect-rules, Deactivate all detection rules>> (optional).

IMPORTANT: You should have already deactivated all of your rules before upgrading your {stack}, so only complete this step if you haven't already.

. Upgrade Kibana. See {ref}/upgrade.html [Upgrade Kibana] for more information.
. Visit the Overview or Alerts page in {elastic-sec} to update the `.siem-signals*` index.
. Migrate old alerts using the <<signals-migration-api, Detection Alerts Migration API >>.
. <<reactivate-detect-rules, Reactivate all detection rules>> .
