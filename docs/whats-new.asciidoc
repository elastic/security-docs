== Retrieval-augmented generation for alerts in Elastic AI Assistant

Elastic AI Assistant now supports {security-guide}/security-assistant.html#rag-for-alerts[retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for alerts]. Using this feature, you can provide information about multiple alerts to AI Assistant, so that it can answer a broader scope of questions relating to alerts in your environment.

[float]
== Detection rules and alerts enhancements

The following enhancements have been added to detection rules and alerts:

[float]
=== JSON diff for Elastic prebuilt rule updates

When Elastic updates a prebuilt detection rule, you can examine the latest version before you {security-guide}/prebuilt-rules-management.html#update-prebuilt-rules[update the rule]. The rule details flyout in **Rule Updates** displays a side-by-side JSON comparison of the rule's **Base version** (what you currently have installed) and the **Update version** that you can choose to install.

[float]
=== Alert suppression supported for threshold rules

{security-guide}/alert-suppression.html[Alert suppression] now supports the threshold detection rule type. You can use it to reduce the number of repeated or duplicate detection alerts created by a threshold rule.

[float]
=== Assign users to alerts

You can now {security-guide}/alerts-ui-manage.html#assign-users-to-alerts[assign users to alerts] that you want them to investigate, and manage alert assignees throughout an alert's lifecycle. Assigned alerts are filterable, and you can find assignees by adding the `kibana.alert.workflow_assignee_ids` field to the Alerts table or by opening an alert's details.

== Bidirectional integration response actions (SentinelOne)

Powered by the {integrations-docs}/sentinel_one[SentinelOne] integration for {agent}, SentinelOne response actions allow you to perform bidirectional actions on protected hosts, such as directing SentinelOne to isolate a suspicious endpoint from your network, without needing to leave the {elastic-sec} UI.

[float]

You can now use `matches` and `does not match` conditions on more fields when configuring {security-guide}/event-filters.html[event filters] and {security-guide}/add-exceptions.html[endpoint exceptions]. Previously, only the `file.path.text` field was supported.

[float]
== New Osquery query timeout setting

When running an Osquery query, you can now set a timeout period, in seconds, after which the query will stop running. Overwriting the default timeout allows you to support queries that require more time to complete. The default and minimum supported value is `60`. The maximum supported value is `900`.
