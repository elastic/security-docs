== Generative AI enhancements

The following generative AI enhancements have been added:

[float]
=== Attack Discovery

Introducing {security-guide}/attack-discovery.html[Attack discovery], a new AI-powered tool that can identify and describe potential attacks that span multiple alerts. It can identify connections between alerts and map them to the MITRE ATT&CK® matrix to help make the most of each security analyst's time, fight alert fatigue, and reduce your mean time to respond.

[float]
=== Elastic AI Assistant UI improvements

{security-guide}/security-assistant.html[Elastic AI Assistant] for {elastic-sec} has a redesigned user interface that uses a flyout instead of a popup, making it fit more smoothly within your workflows and with standard {kib} design patterns. Also, when using OpenAI models, AI Assistant can now "stream" responses, rendering word-by-word rather than appearing as complete text blocks, to provide a more conversational experience.

[float]
== Entity Analytics enhancements

The following enhancements have been added to Entity Analytics:

[float]
=== Asset criticality file upload

You can {security-guide}/asset-criticality.html#bulk-assign-asset-criticality[bulk assign asset criticality] to multiple entities at a time by importing a text file from your asset management tools. This file-based bulk upload feature allows you to quickly and easily import a list of entities and their asset criticality levels into the {security-app}.

[float]
=== Asset criticality can be unassigned

You can unassign {security-guide}/asset-criticality.html[asset criticality] from a host or user, in case the criticality level is no longer known, or the currently assigned level is incorrect.

image::whats-new/images/8.14/unassign-criticality.png[Unassign asset criticality, 50%]

[float]
=== Risk scoring engine processes up to 10,000 alerts per entity

When calculating {security-guide}/entity-risk-scoring.html[entity risk scores], the risk scoring engine now takes into account a maximum of 10,000 alerts per entity. This ensures that the engine remains operational in environments with extremely large data volume.

[float]
=== Entity details flyout is available from the Entity Analytics dashboard 

Clicking on a specific host or user name in the {security-guide}/detection-entity-dashboard.html[Entity Analytics dashboard] now opens the host or user details flyout instead of the host or user details page. This allows you to access entity metadata and risk score information without navigating away from the dashboard.

[float]
=== Entity details flyout shows contribution scores per alert

The **Risk contributions** section of the {security-guide}/hosts-overview.html#host-details-flyout[entity details flyout] now shows the top 10 alerts that contributed to the latest risk scoring calculation, and each alert's contribution score. This makes each entity's risk score easier to understand and gives better insight into which alerts you should investigate at the entity level.

[float]
== Detection rules and alerts enhancements

The following enhancements have been added to detection rules and alerts:

[float]
=== Value list improvements

You can now {security-guide}/value-lists-exceptions.html#edit-value-lists[edit value lists] from the UI, wherever you use them. For example, you can now add items to a value list while creating a rule exception that references that value list.

[role="screenshot"]
image::whats-new/images/8.14/edit-value-lists.png[Edit items in a value list, 90%]

[float]
=== ES|QL fields can be added as custom highlighted fields

When adding custom highlighted fields to an {esql} rule, you can now {security-guide}/rules-ui-create.html#custom-highlighted-esql-fields[specify any fields returned by the rule's query]. This allows you to surface fields that contain useful information for investigating alerts.

[float]
=== Editable setup guide field for detection rules

You can now {security-guide}/rules-ui-create.html#rule-ui-advanced-params[edit the **Setup guide** field] for user-created custom rules. Use this informational field to list rule prerequisites such as required integrations, configuration steps, and anything else needed for the rule to work correctly.

[role="screenshot"]
image::whats-new/images/8.14/setup-guide-field.png[Setup guide field]

[float]
=== Alert suppression improvements 

In 8.14, we're moving {security-guide}/alert-suppression.html[alert suppression] for custom query rules from technical preview to generally available. We're also adding alert suppression to event correlation rules (non-sequence queries only) and new terms rules.

[float]
== {elastic-defend} enhancements

The following enhancements have been added to {elastic-defend}:

[float]
=== Malware file scanning options

When configuring {security-guide}/configure-endpoint-integration-policy.html#malware-protection[malware protection], you can choose whether {elastic-defend} scans files when they're modified or executed. This can improve performance on hosts where files are frequently modified, while continuing to identify malware as it attempts to run.

[role="screenshot"]
image::whats-new/images/8.14/malware-protection.png[Malware protection section, 80%]

[float]
===  Automatic antivirus registration of {elastic-defend}

If you're using {elastic-defend}'s malware protection, you can now automatically {security-guide}/configure-endpoint-integration-policy.html#register-as-antivirus[register {elastic-defend} as the antivirus software] for Windows endpoints.

[role="screenshot"]
image::whats-new/images/8.14/register-as-antivirus.png[Register as antivirus section, 80%]

[float]
== Cloud Security Posture Management support for AWS GovCloud

Elastic's {security-guide}/cspm.html[Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)] integration now supports AWS GovCloud, so you can monitor and track how your GovCloud clusters perform against security benchmarks.
