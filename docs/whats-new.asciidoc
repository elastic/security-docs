== Detection rules enhancements

*New warning for running maintenance windows*

A warning banner displays on the Rules page if a {kibana-ref}/maintenance-windows.html[maintenance window] is running. During an active maintenance window, rule actions won’t run, and alert notifications aren't sent. 

NOTE: To use maintenance windows, you must have the appropriate https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[subscription] and Kibana feature {kibana-ref}/maintenance-windows.html#setup-maintenance-windows[privileges].

*Prebuilt rule updates*

Check out the {security-guide}/prebuilt-rules-downloadable-updates.html[latest updates] to prebuilt rules. To download the latest updates, refer to {security-guide}/rules-ui-management.html#download-prebuilt-rules[Download latest Elastic prebuilt rules].

== Alerts enhancements 

*Control alert notifications and summaries*

The following enhancements give more control over how and when alert notifications are sent. For more information, refer to {security-guide}/rules-ui-create.html#rule-notifications[Set up alert notifications]. 

* You can now specify how often {security-guide}/rules-ui-create.html#rule-notifications[alert notifications] are sent to third-party systems (such as Slack, JIRA, email, etc.). You can apply your preferred frequency to all rule actions, or set notification frequency individually for each action. 
+

+
* You can decide whether to be notified each time an alert is generated, or receive alert summaries. 

* Instead of turning rules off to stop alert notifications, you can {security-guide}/rules-ui-management.html#snooze-rule-actions[snooze rule actions] for a specified time period. When you snooze rule actions, the rule continues to run on its defined schedule, but won’t perform any actions or send alert notifications. 

*Max alerts warning*

When a rule reaches the maximum number of alerts it can generate in a single rule execution, the following {security-guide}/alerts-ui-monitor.html#troubleshoot-max-alerts[warning] is displayed on the rule’s details page and in the rule execution log: `This rule reached the maximum alert limit for the rule execution. Some alerts were not created.` To troubleshoot this event, we recommend you check for unexpected alerts. For more information, refer to {security-guide}/alerts-ui-monitor.html#troubleshoot-max-alerts[Troubleshoot maximum alerts warning].

*Share an alert*

The *Share alert* button in the {security-guide}/view-alert-details.html#view-alert-details[alert details] flyout provides a shareable link you can copy and paste into browsers, cases, messages, and more.

*Edit filter controls on the Alerts page*

The drop-down filter controls on the Alerts page allow you to filter alerts by up to four fields. By default, you can filter by *Status*, *Severity*, *User*, and *Host*, but you can {security-guide}/alerts-ui-manage.html#drop-down-filter-controls[edit these to filter by different fields]. You can also remove, add, and reorder them.

[role="screenshot"]
image::whats-new/images/8.8/alert-controls.png[Alert filter controls]


*New alert suppression options*

A new rule configuration option for {security-guide}/alert-suppression.html[alert suppression] allows you to specify how to handle alerts when a field that's used for suppression does not have a value. 

TIP: To learn how to reduce notifications and alerts, check out our analysis comparison {security-guide}/reduce-notifications-alerts.html[here].

*Filter alerts from the Entity Analytics dashboard*

In the Entity Analytics dashboard, you can now filter alerts on the Alerts page by selecting the number link in the column.

*Select up to three fields for grouping alerts*

You now select up to three fields to {security-guide}/alerts-ui-manage.html#group-alerts[group alerts] by to customize your alerts view. Each group is nested in the Alerts table by order of selection.

== Visualization actions and inline actions added to more places in the {security-app}

{security-guide}/es-ui-overview.html#visualization-actions[Visualization actions], which allow you to examine {es} queries used to retrieve data throughout the {security-app} or perform actions for the selected visualization, have been added to several places in the {security-app}. Look for the Inspect button (image:whats-new/images/8.8/inspect-icon.png[Inspect icon,16,16]) or options menu (image:whats-new/images/8.8/three-dot-menu.png[Options menu icon,17,17]) in the UI. 


{security-guide}/es-ui-overview.html#inline-actions[Inline actions] are displayed when you hover over a specific data field or value and allow you to customize your view or investigate further. They've also been added to more places throughout the {security-app}, such as:

* Explore pages (Host, Network, and User pages)
* Entity analytics (Entity Analytics Dashboard, user risk score, and host risk score features)
* Alerts and events table
* Event details flyout

== Cloud Security enhancements

*New Container Workload Protection (beta)*

You can now use {agent} to {security-guide}/d4c-overview.html[protect your containers] by detecting and preventing malicious behavior and malware, and to capture workload telemetry data. This solution uses a new integration, *Defend for Containers* (D4C), which allows you to create custom alerting and enforcement policies.

*New Cloud Native Vulnerability Management (CNVM) (beta)*

The {security-guide}/vuln-management-overview.html[Cloud Native Vulnerability Management (CNVM)] feature helps you identify known vulnerabilities in your cloud workloads. When it finds vulnerabilities, it enables your remediation efforts by providing metadata such as the CVSS, severity, affected package, and a fix version if available, as well as information about impacted systems. 

[float]
== New "execute" response console command

A new {security-guide}/response-actions.html[response console] command, `execute`, allows you to run shell commands and scripts on the host. The complete output is also saved to a downloadable `.zip` file. 

NOTE: Ensure you have the appropriate {security-guide}/endpoint-management-req.html[privileges] to use the response console. 

[float]
== Delete notes in Timeline 

In Timeline, you can now {security-guide}/timelines-ui.html#conf-timeline-display[delete notes for individual events] or delete investigation notes for the entire Timeline. 

[float]
== Cases enhancements 

The following enhancements have been added to Cases: 

* You can now {security-guide}/cases-open-manage.html#cases-add-files[add files to a case].
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::whats-new/images/8.8/add-files-case.png[Add files to a case]
+
* You can now add the *Cases* column to the Alerts table, which is helpful to quickly identify which alerts have been added to a case. 
* Case activity and history are paginated and sortable. 
* The {security-guide}/case-permissions.html[privileges] for attaching alerts to cases have changed. Now, users need `Read` access to Security and `All` access to Cases.
