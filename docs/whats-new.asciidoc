== Latest risk scoring engine

The latest risk scoring engine generates risk scores on a recurring interval, and allows for easier onboarding and management. The engine is built to factor in risks from all {elastic-sec} use cases. It also allows you to customize and control how and when risk is calculated.

With the new risk scoring engine, you can:

* Preview and enable the risk engine using a centralized one-click onboarding workflow.
* Conveniently migrate to the new engine if you're an existing user of risk scoring.
* Generate risk scores for hosts and users from the last 30 days.
* View the alerts that contributed to an entity's risk score, allowing faster investigations.
* Continue to access entity risk analytics in existing security workflows.
