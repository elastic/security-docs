== Detection rules enhancements

*Alert suppression time window for custom query rules*

You can now {security-guide}/alert-suppression.html[suppress] custom query rule alerts during a specific time window to limit alert volume and further reduce alert noise. Duplicate alerts within that time window will be grouped.

*Connectors can be exported and imported with rules*

Now, when you {security-guide}/rules-ui-management.html#import-export-rules-ui[export and import] a rule that uses action connectors you don't need to handle the connectors separately. Note that sensitive information about the connector (such as authentication credentials) is not included in the export file. You must re-add missing connector details after importing detection rules.

*Cross-cluster search is supported for indicator match rules*

You can now query data in remote clusters and cold-tier data for index patterns specified in indicator match rules.

*Enhancements to rule preview*

The {security-guide}/rules-ui-create.html#preview-rules[Rule preview] panel can be resized.

*New Torq connector for rule actions* 

There's a new Torq connector you can select when configuring rule actions. You must have at least a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum subscription] to use this connector. 

*{ml-cap} job enhancements*

{ml-cap} job names are used throughout the {security-app} instead of job IDs so you can quickly know which {ml-cap} jobs you're interacting with. 

*New prebuilt rules*

40 (TBD) new {security-guide}/prebuilt-rules.html[prebuilt rules] were added in 8.7.0.

== Role-based access control (RBAC) for response actions

New Endpoint management feature privileges in {kib} allow admins to have more granular control over {security-guide}/endpoint-management-req.html[{elastic-defend} features]. Role-based access can now be managed for the following: 

* Hosts running {elastic-defend}
* Trusted applications
* Host isolation exceptions
* Blocklist entries
* Event filters
* {elastic-defend} policies
* File-related operations in the response console

== Response console action enhancements

A new `get file` {security-guide}/response-actions.html[response console] action allows you to retrieve and download a file from a host. Files are downloaded in a password-protected `.zip` archive to prevent the file from running. 

[float]
== Data Quality dashboard 

The {security-guide}/data-quality-dash.html[Data Quality] dashboard allows you to quickly check one or many indices for unmapped fields or fields with mapping conflicts, and makes it easy to track and share the results.

[float]
== Exceptions enhancements

There are several enhancements and UI improvements to rule exceptions:

* When {security-guide}/add-exceptions.html#detection-rule-exceptions[adding a rule exception], you can set an expiration date for the exception so it only temporarily applies. You can view active and expired exceptions under the *Rule exceptions* tab and choose whether to include expired exceptions when exporting rules.
* If a field has mapping conflicts, it has a warning icon (image:images/field-warning-icon.png[Field conflict warning icon,13,13]) and {security-guide}/ts-detection-rules.html#rule-exceptions-field-conflicts[message] that describes the conflicts. You can use this information to prevent exception errors and resolve mapping problems. 
* The *Manage rules* button has been renamed to *Link rules* and the *Import list* button has been renamed to *Import value list*.

[float]
== Alerts enhancements

*Summary visualization for key performance indicators (KPIs)*

The new {security-guide}/visualize-alerts.html#_summary[summary visualization] on the Alerts page shows how alerts are distributed across severity levels, rule names, and specified field such as `host.name`. You can hover and click on elements within the summary to add filters with those values to the Alerts page.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/alert-page-visualizations.png[Alerts page with visualizations section highlighted]

You can also minimize the visualization section and display a summary of key information instead.

image::images/alert-page-viz-collapsed.png[Alerts page with visualizations section collapsed]

*Alert grouping*

Now in beta, you can {security-guide}/alerts-ui-manage.html#group-alerts[group alerts] by rule name, host name, user name, source IP address, or any other field. Each group displays information such as the alerts' severity and how many users, hosts, and alerts are in the group, and you can expand a group to display its alerts.

== Interactive investigation guides query builder UI

{security-guide}/interactive-investigation-guides.html[Interactive investigation guides] (a technical preview feature introduced in 8.6) are now easier to configure with a new query builder UI. Use the form to create filters and build an investigation query, and the syntax is automatically generated and added to the investigation guide editor. The syntax is rendered as a clickable action button that launches the query in Timeline.

== Cloud Security Posture enhancements 

*File and Network events enabled for Session View*

For events to appear in Session View, they must include additional ECS fields related to their context in the Linux process model. Previously, only process events could include the required fields. In 8.6, file and network events can also include the necessary fields, meaning that file and network alerts can appear in Session View in addition to process alerts.

*Capture Linux environment variables*

You can now configure a policy to capture up to five {security-guide}/environment-variable-capture.html[environment variables] (key-value pairs) from Linux hosts. This allows you to capture additional information relevant to investigations. 

*Enhanced Cloud Posture dashboard* 

The Cloud Posture dashboard has an improved user interface, including more ways to directly access the Findings page.

== Threat intelligence enhancements

*Block hashes and malicious files*

You can now {security-guide}/indicators-of-compromise.html#add-indicator-to-blocklist[add indicator values] to the blocklist to prevent selected applications from running on your hosts. You can use MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256 hash values from `file` type indicators. 

*Improvements to indicators*

There are several enhancements and UI improvements to indicators:

* When you investigate an indicator in Timeline, the query's time range is set to seven days before and after the indicator's `timestamp`. 
* You can now delete values entered into the *Stack by* field in the Trend chart.
* When you open the Indicator table's field browser, the `agent`, `base`, and `event` field categories are preselected narrow the scope of relevant fields.
* The Indicator details flyout now has the *Overview* and *Table* tabs when you open indicator details from a case comment.

[float]
== Cases enhancements

*Cases can be shared*

Each case has a universally unique identifier (UUID) that you can {security-guide}/cases-open-manage.html#cases-copy-case-uuid[copy and share]. You can access a case's UUID from the Cases page or the case details page. 

[role="screenshot"]
image::whats-new/images/8.7/cases-copy-case-id.png[Copy Case ID option in More actions menu 40%,40%]

*Enhancements to cases*

Several changes have been made to the Cases table to improve usability:

* Now you can bulk edit assignees. 
* The new *Updated on* column shows the last time cases were modified.
* The *Status*, *Severity*, and *Name* columns are sortable.
* Any filters and sorting that you apply to the table are persisted in the browser.


[float]
== Osquery enhancements

*Event and alert data can be dynamically transferred into Osquery queries*

Instead of hard-coding alert and event values into Osquery queries, you can now use {security-guide}/osquery-placeholder-fields.html[placeholder fields] to dynamically pass this data into queries. Placeholder fields function like parameters and you can use them to build flexible and re-usable queries. 

*Add Osquery queries from rule's investigation guide to Osquery Response Action*

Now, if a rule is using an Osquery query in it's investigation guide, you can quickly add the query to the rule's {security-guide}/osquery-response-action.html#add-osquery-response-action[Osquery Response Action]  when editing the rule.
