== 7.14 release

[discrete]
[[sec-nav-changes-7.14]]
=== Navigation changes

The {security-app} has a newly organized, simplified navigation that's more aligned with new {kib} standards. The side navigation pane now groups features into the following categories: *Detect*, *Explore*, *Investigate*, and *Manage*. The new navigation is designed to provide one-click access to the Security features you need the most. See the <<es-ui-overview, UI overview>> to read more.

[[sec-term-changes-7.14]]
=== Terminology changes

Please note the following updates to terminology:

* The former *Administration* page has been renamed to *Endpoints*. Admins can manage endpoints, trusted applications, and event filters from the *Manage* section.
* The former *Detection alerts* page has been abbreviated to *Alerts*.

[discrete]
[[sec-enhancements-7.14]]
=== New features

* <<install-endpoint.html#malware-protection, Malware protection>> has been added to Linux endpoints. The protection leverages an ELF file scanning capability, which offers broad coverage for trojans, cryptominers, rootkits, and exploits.
* Host isolation allows you respond to malicious activity by isolating a Windows or macOS host from your network, preventing lateral movement across other hosts.
* A new *Threat Intel* tab has been added to the alert summary panel and provides threat intelligence context, allowing you to quickly triage or investigate an alert by providing relevant details from a single location. A new Threat Intelligence view on the home page shows the total number of threat indicator events collected by the Threat Intel Filebeat module.
* 33 new <<prebuilt-rules.html, prebuilt rules>>. 
* A new <<cases-ui-integrations.html#cases-ui-integrations, Swimlane connector for cases and alerts>> allows you to
forward alerts and cases to your Swimlane application for enhanced incident and workflow management.
* Admins can now specifically assign `All`, `Read`, or `None` <<case-permissions.html, privileges>> to users for the Cases feature.
* New functionality and usability improvements were added to the https://github.com/elastic/integrations/tree/master/packages/osquery_manager[Osquery Manager integration], including the ability to save and edit a library of queries, constraining queries to specific operating systems, and more.
* <<event-filters, Event filters>> allow admins to prevent endpoint events they do not need or want stored from streaming - allowing better storage utilization in {es}.

[[sec-experimental-7.14]]
=== Experimental features

IMPORTANT: The following features are experimental and may be changed or removed completely in a future release. Elastic will take a best effort approach to fix any issues, but experimental features are not subject to the support of official GA features.

* Host Risk Score: A framework to figure out the most suspicious hosts in your environment, based on their alert activity.
For more information, click https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/docs/experimental-machine-learning/host-risk-score.md[here].
* A new experimental https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/tree/main/docs/experimental-machine-learning[URL Spoofing] model framework allows you to proactively detect and monitor spoofing activity by raising an alert whenever you interact with a predicted malicious URL in your environment. Requires Platinum or higher https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[subscription].
