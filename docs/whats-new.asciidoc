== Kubernetes and Cloud Security Posture enhancements

The {security-guide}/kubernetes-dashboard.html[Kubernetes dashboard] provides insight into Linux process data from your Kubernetes clusters. You can also {security-guide}/kubernetes-dashboard.html#k8s-dash-setup[deploy an Elastic DaemonSet] to your Kubernetes clusters to collect session data. This data, which includes new Kubernetes-specific fields, appears in summary on the Kubernetes dashboard.

The {security-guide}/cloud-posture-dashboard.html[Cloud Posture dashboard] allows you to check your Kubernetes infrastructure's configuration against security best practices, and provides steps for remediating any issues it identifies.

To get these insights, you first need to install the Kubernetes Security Posture Management integration, which is now in beta.

== Detection rules enhancements

*New terms rule*

A {security-guide}/rules-ui-create.html#create-new-terms-rule[new terms] rule generates an alert for each new term it detects in source documents within a specified time range.

image::whats-new/images/8.4/new-terms.png[New terms rule]


*Data views available in rule creation*

When you create a rule, you can now {security-guide}/rules-ui-create.html#views-index-patterns[specify data views] as the data source in order to use runtime fields, which are associated with a data view.

*Fallback to @timestamp is configurable when timestamp override is defined*

This feature allows you to disable @timestamp as a fallback timestamp field when you’ve defined a timestamp override.

*New option to preview rules*

The new *Advanced query preview* option allows you to set the preview's timeframe, rule interval, and look-back time, providing more control to fine-tune query results.

*Improved bulk action handling for detection rules*

When you select prebuilt _and_ custom rules and attempt to perform a bulk action that can only be done on custom rules, {elastic-sec} now determines which rules are compatible and performs the action only on those rules.

*Wildcards supported in detection rule exceptions*

Wildcards are now supported when defining {security-guide}/detections-ui-exceptions.html#detection-rule-exceptions[exceptions] for detection rules, and accept new operators `matches` and `does not match`.

*New prebuilt rules*

18 new {security-guide}/prebuilt-rules.html[prebuilt rules] were added in 8.4.0.

*Prerequisites and setup guides for Elastic prebuilt rules*

Elastic prebuilt rules now provide additional information to help you identify and meet their {security-guide}/rules-ui-management.html#rule-prerequisites[prerequisites]. You can confirm these requirements in the *Related integrations* and *Required fields* sections of a rule's details page, and consult its *Setup guide* for additional guidance.

[role="screenshot"]

NOTE: Content for these new sections is delivered in a prebuilt rules update, independent of {stack} release versioning.

[discrete]
== Response console for endpoint response actions

The new response console allows you to perform response actions on an endpoint using a terminal-like interface. You can enter action commands and receive almost immediate feedback. Actions are also logged in the endpoint’s actions log for reference.

== Troubleshooting "Unhealthy" status for {agent}

Integration policy errors and statuses are now provided in {fleet} and {elastic-sec} to help troubleshoot when an {agent} has an "unhealthy" status.

[discrete]
== Alerts enhancements

*New Alerts page visualizations*

The Alerts page now displays a single visualization pane, with a menu to select *Table*, *Trend*, or *Treemap*. Treemap is a new view that shows alert distribution as proportionally-sized tiles. This view helps you quickly triage the most critical alerts.

[role="screenshot"]
image::whats-new/images/8.4/treemap-view.png[Alerts treemap view]

*New Insights section in alert details*

The Alert details flyout now has a new {security-guide}/view-alert-details.html#alert-details-insights[*Insights* section], which shows users how an alert is related to other alerts and provides options to investigate related alerts. You can leverage this information to quickly find patterns between alerts, then take action.

[role="screenshot"]
image::whats-new/images/8.4/insights.png[Insights section]

*Process event analyzer now includes alerts*

You can now view alerts associated with an event when viewing the event in the process analyzer. This allows you to examine and compare alerts with the same source event.

NOTE: This functionality requires a Platinum or Enterprise subscription, and the `xpack.securitySolution.enableExperimental: ['insightsRelatedAlertsByProcessAncestry']` feature flag must be added to the `kibana.yml` file.)

[discrete]
== Cases enhancements

*New Webhook - Case Management case connector*

The Webhook - Case Management connector allows you to build a custom connector for any third-party case/ticket management system. This offers more flexibility when deciding what third-party case/ticket management system you want to send cases and case updates to.

*New sub-feature privilege for cases*

The *Delete cases and comments* sub-feature privilege determines whether a user can delete cases and comments. Users with current `All` access to cases are automatically granted the delete privilege upon upgrading to 8.4. However, users with current `read` access to cases are not automatically granted the delete privilege upon upgrading to 8.4. An admin can modify these user privileges.

[discrete]
== Endpoint enhancements

*New credential hardening protection*

You can now configure {security-guide}/configure-endpoint-integration-policy.html#attack-surface-reduction[credential hardening protection] in an integration policy. Credential hardening prevents attackers from stealing credentials stored in Windows system process memory. Turn on the toggle to remove any overly permissive access rights that aren’t required for standard interaction with the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS).

[role="screenshot"]
image::whats-new/images/8.4/credential-hardening.png[Credential hardening protection]

*Endpoint self-healing rollback*

{security-guide}/self-healing-rollback.html[Endpoint self-healing rollback] is a new feature that rolls back file changes and processes on Windows endpoints when enabled protection features generate a prevention alert.

[discrete]
== Run query packs from an alert

When {security-guide}//alerts-run-osquery.html[running a live query] from an alert, you can now choose to run single queries or query packs.
