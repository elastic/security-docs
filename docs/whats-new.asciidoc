== Detection rules enhancements

*New warning for running maintenance windows*

A warning banner displays on the Rules page if a {kibana-ref}/maintenance-windows.html[maintenance window] is running. During an active maintenance window, rule actions won’t run, and alert notifications aren't sent. 

NOTE: To use maintenance windows, you must have the appropriate https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[subscription] and Kibana feature {kibana-ref}/maintenance-windows.html#setup-maintenance-windows[privileges].

*Prebuilt rule updates*

Check out the {security-guide}/prebuilt-rules-downloadable-updates.html[latest updates] to prebuilt rules. To download the latest updates, refer to {security-guide}/rules-ui-management.html#download-prebuilt-rules[Download latest Elastic prebuilt rules].

== Alerts enhancements 

*Control alert notifications and summaries*

The following enhancements give more control over how and when alert notifications are sent. For more information, refer to {security-guide}/rules-ui-create.html#rule-notifications[Set up alert notifications]. 

* You can now specify how often {security-guide}/rules-ui-create.html#rule-notifications[alert notifications] are sent to third-party systems (such as Slack, JIRA, email, etc.). You can apply your preferred frequency to all rule actions, or set notification frequency individually for each action. 
+

+
* You can decide whether to be notified each time an alert is generated, or receive alert summaries. 

* Instead of turning rules off to stop alert notifications, you can {security-guide}/rules-ui-management.html#snooze-rule-actions[snooze rule actions] for a specified time period. When you snooze rule actions, the rule continues to run on its defined schedule, but won’t perform any actions or send alert notifications. 

*Max alerts warning*

When a rule reaches the maximum number of alerts it can generate in a single rule execution, the following {security-guide}/alerts-ui-monitor.html#troubleshoot-max-alerts[warning] is displayed on the rule’s details page and in the rule execution log: `This rule reached the maximum alert limit for the rule execution. Some alerts were not created.` To troubleshoot this event, we recommend you investigate alerts for any anomalies. For more information, refer to {security-guide}/alerts-ui-manage.html[Manage detection alerts].

*Share an alert*

The *Share alert* button in the {security-guide}/view-alert-details.html#view-alert-details[alert details] flyout provides a shareable link you can copy and paste into browsers, cases, messages, and more.

*Edit filter controls on the Alerts page*

The drop-down filter controls on the Alerts page allow you to filter alerts by up to four fields. By default, you can filter by *Status*, *Severity*, *User*, and *Host*, but you can {security-guide}/alerts-ui-manage.html#drop-down-filter-controls[edit these to filter by different fields]. You can also remove, add, and reorder them.

[role="screenshot"]
image::whats-new/images/8.8/alert-controls.png[Alert filter controls]


*New alert suppression options*

A new rule configuration option for {security-guide}/alert-suppression.html[alert suppression] allows you to specify how to handle alerts when a field that's used for suppression does not have a value. 

TIP: To learn how to reduce notifications and alerts, check out our analysis comparison {security-guide}/reduce-notifications-alerts.html[here].

*Filter alerts from the Entity Analytics dashboard*

In the Entity Analytics dashboard, you can now filter alerts on the Alerts page by selecting the number link in the column.

*Select up to three fields for grouping alerts*

You now select up to three fields to {security-guide}/alerts-ui-manage.html#group-alerts[group alerts] by to customize your alerts view. Each group is nested in the Alerts table by order of selection.

== Visualization actions and inline actions added to more places in the {security-app}

{security-guide}/es-ui-overview.html#visualization-actions[Visualization actions], which allow you to examine {es} queries used to retrieve data throughout the {security-app} or perform actions for the selected visualization, have been added to several places in the {security-app}. Look for the Inspect button (image:whats-new/images/8.8/inspect-icon.png[Inspect icon,16,16]) or options menu (image:whats-new/images/8.8/three-dot-menu.png[Options menu icon,17,17]) in the UI. 


{security-guide}/es-ui-overview.html#inline-actions[Inline actions] are displayed when you hover over a specific data field or value and allow you to customize your view or investigate further. They've also been added to more places throughout the {security-app}, such as:

* Explore pages (Host, Network, and User pages)
* Entity analytics (Entity Analytics Dashboard, user risk score, and host risk score features)
* Alerts and events table
* Event details flyout

== Cloud Security enhancements

*New Container Workload Protection (CWP) (beta)*

You can now use {agent} to {security-guide}/d4c-overview.html[monitor and protect your containers] and prevent container drift. This solution uses a new integration, *Defend for Containers* (D4C), which allows you to create custom alerting and enforcement policies. 

*New Cloud Native Vulnerability Management(CNVM) (beta)*

The {security-guide}/vuln-management-overview.html[Cloud Native Vulnerability Management (CNVM)] feature helps you identify known vulnerabilities in your cloud workloads. When it finds vulnerabilities, it enables your remediation efforts by providing metadata such as the CVE identifier, CVSS score, severity, affected package, and a fix version if available, as well as information about impacted systems. 

[float]
== New "execute" response console command

A new {security-guide}/response-actions.html[response console] command, `execute`, allows you to run shell commands and scripts on the host. The complete output is also saved to a downloadable `.zip` file. 

NOTE: Ensure you have the appropriate {security-guide}/endpoint-management-req.html[privileges] to use the response console. 

[float]
== Delete notes in Timeline 

In Timeline, you can now {security-guide}/timelines-ui.html#conf-timeline-display[delete notes for individual events] or delete investigation notes for the entire Timeline. 

[float]
== Cases enhancements 

The following enhancements have been added to Cases: 

* You can now {security-guide}/cases-open-manage.html#cases-add-files[add files to a case].
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::whats-new/images/8.8/add-files-case.png[Add files to a case]
+
* You can now add the *Cases* column to the Alerts table, which is helpful to quickly identify which alerts have been added to a case. 
* Case activity and history are paginated and sortable. 
* The {security-guide}/case-permissions.html[privileges] for attaching alerts to cases have changed. Now, users need `Read` access to Security and `All` access to Cases.
