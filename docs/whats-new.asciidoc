== Terminology changes

*"Endpoint Security integration" has been renamed to "Endpoint and Cloud Security integration"*

Due to the launch of https://www.elastic.co/security/cloud-security[Elastic Security for Cloud], the *Endpoint Security integration*, which allows the {agent} to monitor for events on your host, has been renamed to *Endpoint and Cloud Security integration*. Please note that general industry term references to endpoint security have not changed.

== New dashboards summarize critical information

A new *Dashboards* section, which includes two new dashboards to help you visualize critical information, has been added to the navigation menu in the {security-app}.

The {security-guide}/overview-dashboard.html[*Overview* dashboard] provides an overview of detections, external alerts, and event trends. Use it to assess overall system health and find anomalies that may require further investigation.

[role="screenshot"]
image::whats-new/images/8.3/overview-pg.png[]

The {security-guide}/detection-response-dashboard.html[*Detection & Response* dashboard] provides focused visibility into the daily operations of your security environment. Use it to monitor recent and high priority detection alerts and cases, and identify the top hosts and users associated with the most alerts so you can triage effectively.

== Technical preview features

*Cloud Security Posture Management*

Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and Kubernetes security posture management (KSPM) help you compare your cloud and Kubernetes infrastructure to security best practices. Refer to our {security-guide}/security-posture-management.html[documentation] for setup instructions.

*User risk score*

https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/209b40b0a30d87898d75bb2d5dc3f2e068b5f09d/docs/experimental-machine-learning/user-risk-score.md[User risk score] assigns a score to highlight risky users within your environment. It uses a transform with a scripted metric aggregation to calculate scores based on detection rule alerts within a 90-day window. The transform runs hourly to update the score as new detection rule alerts are generated. Each user risk score is normalized on a scale of 0 to 100.

[discrete]
== New Authentications tab added to Users page

An *Authentications* tab has been added to the Users page to show successful and failed authentication events per user.

You can create a {security-guide}/alerts-ui-monitor.html#rule-execution-logs[global search filter] based on a specific rule execution by selecting the filter icon in the *Actions* column of the *Rule execution logs* tab on the rule details page. Enabling this filter replaces any previously applied filters.
