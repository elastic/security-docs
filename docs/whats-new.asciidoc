== New dashboards provide a summary of critical information

Two new dashboards have been added to the {securty-app} to provide a visualization of critical information.

The {securty-guide}/overview-dashboard.html[*Overview* dashboard] provides a high-level snapshot of detections, external alerts, and event trends. Use this dashboard to assess overall system health and find anomalies that may require further investigation.

The {securty-guide}/detection-response-dashboard.html[*Detections & Response* dashboard] dashboard provides focused visibility into the daily operations of your security environment. Use this dashboard to monitor recent and high priority detection alerts and cases, and identify the top hosts and users associated with the most alerts so you can triage effectively.

== Technical preview features

*Introducing Cloud Security Posture Management*

{security-guide}/security-posture-management.html[*Cloud Security Posture Management*] helps you compare your cloud and Kubernetes infrastructure to security best practices.

*User risk score*

https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/209b40b0a30d87898d75bb2d5dc3f2e068b5f09d/docs/experimental-machine-learning/user-risk-score.md[User risk score] assigns a score to highlight risky users from within your environment. It utilizes a transform with a scripted metric aggregation to calculate scores based on detection rule alerts with an "open" status within a 5-day window. The transform runs hourly to update the score as new detection rule alerts are generated. Each user risk score is normalized to a scale of 0 to 100.

[discrete]
== New Authentications tab added to Users page

An *Authentications* tab has been added to the Users page to show how many hosts a user has authenticated.
