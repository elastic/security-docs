*Rules page enhancements*

The following applies to the *Rules* and *Rules monitoring* tabs.

*Event filters and host isolation exceptions can be applied per policy*

Users with a https://www.elastic.co/pricing/[Platinum or Enterprise license] can apply new or existing {security-guide}/event-filters.html[event filters] and {security-guide}/host-isolation-exceptions.html[host isolation exceptions] to a specific integration policy instead of globally. This allows you to configure settings that may be unique to a specific group within your network.

*Network map data requires new permissions*

To view network map data, you need at least `Read` privileges for `Maps`. Refer to {security-guide}/conf-map-ui.html[Configure network map data] for more information.

*Alert enhancements*

On the Alerts page, the Trend and Count tables now allow you to aggregate alert data based on any aggregatable ECS field. Previously, only a handful of fields were visible.

The {security-guide}/alerts-ui-manage.html#view-alert-details[alert details flyout] has a new layout that highlights relevant fields. You can also now update the alert's status directly from the flyout.

*Indicator match rule enhancements*

In addition to improvements to indicator match rule performance, the default indicator index query for custom and prebuilt {security-guide}/rules-ui-create.html#create-indicator-rule[indicator match rules] has been updated to `@timestamp > "now-30d/d"` to fine-tune the query range and performance.
