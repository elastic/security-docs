[float]
== Generative AI enhancements

[float]
=== Improved Automatic Import capabilities

{security-guide}/automatic-import.html[Automatic Import] can now use a larger variety of large language models and accept larger log samples in a wider range of common formats.

[float]
=== Analyze more alerts with Attack Discovery

{security-guide}/attack-discovery.html[Attack Discovery] can now analyze up to 500 alerts at once, and provides higher-quality responses.

[float]
=== Customize Elastic AI Assistant using Knowledge Base

Elastic AI Assistant's new Knowledge Base feature allows you to specify individual documents or entire indices that AI Assistant will remember and use as context. This improves the relevance, quality, and customization of its responses.

[float]
== Entity Analytics enhancements

[float]
=== Manage persisted entity metadata with entity store

preview:[] The entity store feature allows you to query, reconcile, and maintain entity metadata from various sources, such as ingested logs, integrated identity providers, external asset repositories, and more. By extracting and storing entities from all indices in the {elastic-sec} default data view, the entity store lets you query entity metadata without real-time data searches.

After you enable the entity store, the Entity Analytics dashboard displays the **Entities** section, which offers a comprehensive view of all hosts and users in your environment. You can filter them by their source, entity risk level, and asset criticality level.
// {security-guide}/entity-store.html[entity store] – link to be added when PR is merged
// {security-guide}/detection-entity-dashboard.html#entity-entities[**Entities** section]

[float]
=== Asset criticality is available by default

The advanced setting for enabling {security-guide}/asset-criticality.html[asset criticality] has been removed, and this feature is now available by default.

[float]
=== Run entity risk scoring in multiple spaces 

You can now enable and run {security-guide}/entity-risk-scoring.html[entity risk scoring] in multiple {kib} spaces. This allows you to analyze and monitor entity risk in different contexts simultaneously.

[float]
=== Recalculate entity risk scores after file upload

When you {security-guide}/asset-criticality.html#bulk-assign-asset-criticality[bulk assign asset criticality] using the file upload feature, the newly assigned criticality levels are automatically factored in during the next hourly risk scoring calculation. You can now manually trigger an immediate recalculation of entity risk scores by clicking **Recalculate entity risk scores now** during the file upload process.

[float]
== Detection rules and alerts enhancements

[float]
=== Enable prebuilt detection rules on installation

Previously, {security-guide}/prebuilt-rules-management.html#load-prebuilt-rules[installing and enabling prebuilt rules] took two steps. You can now do both in one step with the **Install and enable** option. This works for both single and multiple rules.

[float]
=== Run rules manually

{security-guide}/rules-ui-management.html#manually-run-rules[Manually run rules] for testing purposes or additional rule coverage. Details about manual runs (such as the status of each run, the total number of runs that will occur, and more) are shown on the **Execution results** tab of the rule details page. Alerts generated from manual rule runs have the `kibana.alert.rule.execution.type: manual` field value pair in the alert document.

[float]
=== Exclude cold and frozen data from rule execution

Rules that query cold and frozen data tiers might perform more slowly. To {security-guide}/exclude-cold-frozen-data-individual-rules.html[exclude query results from cold and frozen tiers], add a Query DSL filter that ignores cold and frozen documents when executing. This can help {es} exclude cold and frozen data more efficiently.

[float]
=== View {es} queries that run during rule execution

When previewing a rule, you can also {security-guide}/rules-ui-create.html#view-rule-es-queries[learn about its {es} queries], which are submitted when the rule runs. This information can help you identify and troubleshoot potential rule issues. You can also use it to confirm that your rule is retrieving the expected data. This option is provided for {esql} and EQL rules only.

[float]
=== Alert suppression is generally available for more rule types

{security-guide}/alert-suppression.html[Alert suppression] is generally available for the indicator match, threshold, {ml}, {esql}, and new terms rule types. It is still in technical preview for event correlation rules.

[float]
== Investigations enhancements

[float]
=== Add notes to alerts, events, and Timelines

You can now attach {security-guide}/add-manage-notes.html[notes] to alerts, events, and Timelines, and manage them from the **Notes** page. This provides an easy way to incorporate notes into your investigative workflows to coordinate responses, conduct threat hunting, and share investigative findings.

[float]
=== View analyzed events from the alert details flyout

preview:[] By enabling the new `securitySolution:enableVisualizationsInFlyout` advanced setting, you can {security-guide}/view-alert-details.html#expanded-visualizations-view[view analyzed alerts and events] in the **Visualize** tab of the alert details flyout. This allows you to maintain the context of the Alerts table during your investigation and provides an easy way to preview related alerts and events.

[float]
=== Resize alert and event details flyouts

You can now resize the alert and event details flyouts and choose how they're displayed—over the Alerts table or next to it.
// PR pending

[float]
== {elastic-defend} and response actions enhancements

[float]
=== More SentinelOne third-party response actions

Additional third-party response actions are available using Elastic's {security-guide}/third-party-actions.html#sentinelone-response-actions[SentinelOne] integration and connector:

* Get processes
* Terminate a process

[float]
=== {elastic-defend}'s automated response actions support all rule types

You can now configure any detection rule type to perform {elastic-defend}'s {security-guide}/automated-response-actions.html[automated response actions].

[float]
=== New rules for {elastic-defend}'s endpoint protection features

New prebuilt rules tailored for each of {elastic-defend}'s endpoint protections features—malware, ransomware, memory threats, and malicious behavior—allow you to configure actions tailored for detection or prevention of each type.
// PR pending

[float]
== Cloud Security enhancements

[float]
=== Ingest third-party cloud security data

You can now ingest cloud security data from several third-party sources—Falco, AWS Security Hub, and Wiz—into {elastic-sec}. The data appears on the **Alerts** and **Findings** pages, and in the user and host details flyouts.
// {security-guide}/ingest-third-party-cloud-security-data.html[ingest cloud security data] – link to be added when PR is merged

[float]
=== Simplify posture data collection with agentless Cloud Security Posture Management deployment

Elastic's native {security-guide}/cspm.html[Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)] integration now supports agentless deployment, giving you an easier and more streamlined way to collect posture data from your cloud service providers.
