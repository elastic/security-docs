[[name-changes-8.0]]
== Terminology changes

*"Index patterns" has been renamed to "Data views" in {kib}*

A {kibana-ref}/data-views.html[data view] defines what specific data to display in {kib}. Each data view points to one or more index patterns, data streams, or index aliases. An *index pattern* now refers to a string that selects one or more indices. In {elastic-sec}, the default space in the Security data view is `.alerts-security.alerts-default` and includes the following index patterns:

* `auditbeat-*`
* `filebeat-*`
* `logs-*`
* `winlogbeat-*`
* `apm-*-transaction`*
* `traces-apm*`
* `endgame-*`
* `packetbeat-*`

To update these defaults, go to *Stack Management > Advanced Settings > Security Solution > Elasticsearch indices*.

NOTE: To make the *Data view* option appear in an environment with legacy alerts, a user with elevated role privileges must visit the {es-sec-app}, open a page that displays alert data (such as the Overview page), then refresh the page. The user's role privileges must allow them to enable the detections feature in a {kib} space. Refer to {security-guide}/detections-permissions-section.html#enable-detections-ui[Enable and access detections] for more information.

[[index-updates-8.0]]
== Index and privilege updates

*Index changes*

* The system index for detection alerts has been renamed from `.siem-signals-<space-id>` to `.alerts-security.alerts-<space-id>`. Users who use the detections feature require new privileges for these indices. Users also need new privileges to {security-guide}/alerts-ui-manage.html[view alerts] and {security-guide}/rules-ui-create.html#preview-rules[preview rules]. Refer to {security-guide}/detections-permissions-section.html[Detections prerequisites and requirements] for a breakdown of what privileges are required to access specific detection features.
* The schema used for alert documents in {elastic-sec} has changed. Users that access documents in the `.siem-signals-<space-id>` indices, such as customer dashboards, will need to update their API queries and scripts to operate correctly on the new 8.x alert documents. Refer to the new {security-guide}/alert-schema.html[alert schema] to view legacy 7.x field names and the updated field names for 8.x, and review {security-guide}/query-alert-indices.html[best practices on how to query alert indices].
* You can now grant feature privileges for Cases separately from privileges for {elastic-sec}. Refer to {security-guide}/case-permissions.html[Cases prerequisites] for more information.
* New Full Disk Access approval is needed when deploying {elastic-endpoint} on macOS. Refer to {security-guide}/deploy-elastic-endpoint.html[Install Elastic Endpoint manually] to view installation requirements.

[[features-8.0]]
== New features and enhancements

*Rules page includes enhanced tools and a simplified UI*

The Rules page has been enhanced to be more compact and user-friendly so you can analyze information quickly. In addition, on the {security-guide}/alerts-ui-monitor.html[*Rule Monitoring*] tab, you can now perform the same actions that are available on the main *Rules* tab, such as modifying or deleting rules, activating or deactivating rules, exporting or importing rules, and duplicating prebuilt rules.

--
The rule {security-guide}/rules-ui-management.html#import-export-rules-ui[export and import tool] now includes any exception lists associated with the rules being exported or imported.

*Threat intelligence enhancements*

* An explicit default value (`threat.indicator`) has been added to the threat indicator path setting that indicator match rules use when searching indicator indices for threat intelligence data. If a value for the indicator path setting has not been defined before upgrading to 8.0, migrated indicator match rules are given a default value of `threatintel.indicator`. This allows migrated rules to continue using indicator data from {filebeat} 7.x indices.
* Support for the `threat.feed.name` field has been added in the {security-guide}/alerts-ui-manage.html#view-alert-details[Alert details] flyout and Timeline view.
* You can now use {agent} integrations with the Threat Intelligence view to ingest threat intelligence data into your environment. The Threat Intelligence view also supports {filebeat} Threat intel module integrations and custom integrations. Refer to {security-guide}/es-threat-intel-integrations.html[Enable threat intelligence integrations] for setup instructions.
