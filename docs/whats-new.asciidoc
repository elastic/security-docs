== Response actions enhancements

The following enhancements have been added to response actions:

[float]
=== Automated response actions for host processes

You can now add {elastic-defend}'s `kill-process` or `suspend-process` {security-guide}/response-actions.html[response actions] to detection rules. This allows you to automatically terminate or suspend a process on an affected host when an event meets the rule's criteria.

[float]
=== Third-party response actions (SentinelOne)

You can now {security-guide}/third-party-actions.html#sentinelone-response-actions[direct SentinelOne] to perform response actions on protected hosts without leaving the {elastic-sec} UI. You can isolate and release a host from detection alerts and the response console, and view third-party actions in the response actions history log.

[float]
== Entity Analytics enhancements

The following enhancements have been added to Entity Analytics:

[float]
=== Asset criticality

You can now assign an {security-guide}/asset-criticality.html[asset criticality] level to your entities based on their importance to your organization. For example, you can assign **Extreme impact** to business-critical entities, or **Low impact** to entities that pose minimal risk to your security posture.

The risk scoring engine includes asset criticality as an input when calculating entity risk scores.

With asset criticality, you can strengthen your threat detection capabilities by focusing your alert triage, threat-hunting, and investigation activities on high-impact entities.

The redesigned {security-guide}/hosts-overview.html#host-details-flyout[host details flyout] and {security-guide}/users-page.html#user-details-flyout[user details flyout] allow you to:

* View entity risk data and all risk contributions. Expand the risk summary section to view details about the entity's risk contributions.
* View and assign asset criticality to your entities.
* View relevant entity details such as the entity ID, when the entity was first and last seen, and the associated IP addresses and operating system.

== Cloud Security enhancements

The following enhancements have been added to Cloud Security:

[float]
=== Benchmark rules can be turned off

You can now turn individual {security-guide}/cspm-benchmark-rules.html[benchmark rules] on or off.
