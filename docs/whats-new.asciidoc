[[sec-enhancements-7.14]]
=== New features

* <<malware-protection, Malware protection>> has been added to Linux endpoints. The protection leverages an ELF file scanning capability, which offers broad coverage for trojans, cryptominers, rootkits, and exploits.
* Host isolation allows you respond to malicious activity by isolating a Windows or macOS host from your network, preventing lateral movement across other hosts.
* A new *Threat Intel* tab has been added to the alert summary panel and provides threat intelligence context, allowing you to quickly triage or investigate an alert by providing relevant details from a single location. A new Threat Intelligence view on the home page shows the total number of threat indicator events collected by the Threat Intel Filebeat module.
* 33 new <<prebuilt-rules, prebuilt rules>>.
* A new <<cases-ui-integrations, Swimlane connector for cases and alerts>> allows you to
forward alerts and cases to your Swimlane application for enhanced incident and workflow management.
* Admins can now specifically assign `All`, `Read`, or `None` <<case-permissions, privileges>> to users for the Cases feature.
* New functionality and usability improvements were added to the https://github.com/elastic/integrations/tree/master/packages/osquery_manager[Osquery Manager integration], including the ability to save and edit a library of queries, constraining queries to specific operating systems, and more.
* <<event-filters, Event filters>> allow admins to prevent endpoint events they do not need or want stored from streaming - allowing better storage utilization in {es}.

For more information, click https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/docs/experimental-machine-learning/host-risk-score.md[here].
* A new experimental https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/tree/main/docs/experimental-machine-learning[URL Spoofing] model framework allows you to proactively detect and monitor spoofing activity by raising an alert whenever you interact with a predicted malicious URL in your environment. Requires Platinum or higher https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[subscription].
