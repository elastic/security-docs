== Latest entity risk scoring engine provides greater scalability and performance

The latest <<entity-risk-scoring, risk scoring engine>> generates risk scores on a recurring interval, and allows for easier onboarding and management. The engine is built to factor in risks from all {elastic-sec} use cases. It also allows you to customize and control how and when risk is calculated.

With the new risk scoring engine, you can:

* Preview and enable the risk engine using a centralized one-click onboarding workflow.
* Conveniently migrate to the new engine if you're an existing user of risk scoring.
* Generate risk scores for hosts and users from the last 30 days.
* View the alerts that contributed to an entity's risk score, allowing faster investigations.
* Continue to access entity risk analytics in existing security workflows.

== Agent tamper protection with {elastic-defend}

For hosts enrolled in {elastic-defend}, you can prevent unauthorized attempts to uninstall {agent} and {elastic-endpoint} by enabling *Agent tamper protection* on the Agent policy. This offers an additional layer of security by preventing users from bypassing or disabling {elastic-defend}'s endpoint protections. 

When enabled, {agent} and {elastic-endpoint} can only be uninstalled on the host by including the policy's generated uninstall token in the uninstall CLI command.
