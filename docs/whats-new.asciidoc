=== New features

*Malicious behavior protection for Linux, Windows, and macOS hosts*

<<behavior-protection, Malicious behavior protection>> detects and stops threats by monitoring the behavior of system processes for suspicious activity. It leverages existing malware and ransomware prevention with dynamic prevention of post-execution behavior. Malicious behavior is available for customers with a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or Enterprise license].

*Memory threat protection for Windows hosts*

<<memory-protection, Memory threat protection>> detects and stops many of the techniques used for process injection via shellcode, where an attacker attempts to avoid detection by executing an attack from memory instead of from on-disk, where most detection tools operate. Adversaries leverage in-memory attacks to evade common defensive technologies. {elastic-sec} also stops sub-techniques such as thread execution hijacking, asynchronous procedure call, process hollowing, and process doppelgänging. Memory threat protection is available for customers with a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or Enterprise license].

*Enhanced Alerts page view*

The <<alerts-ui-manage, Alerts page>> has several new enhancements, all designed to help triage alerts faster. A few of these include:

* Updated alert statuses (`Open`, `Acknowledged`, and `Closed`)
* New options to group alerts by specific parameters and view individual alert counts
* New options to customize the Alerts table view

*Threat intelligence data enhancements*

The following enhancements have been made to alerts enriched with threat intel data:

* The `securitySolution:defaultThreatIndex` <<update-sec-indices, advanced setting>> allows you to define threat intelligence indices that {elastic-sec} will use when collecting threat indicators. The setting controls features that query threat indices, such as the Threat Intelligence view on the <<overview-ui, Overview page>> and the default indicator index values for indicator match rules.
* The event enrichment query performance has been improved.
* UX enhancements to the *Threat Intel* tab in the Alert details flyout allow you to view threat matches and their correlating details.

In {stack}  7.15, this feature is now available for Linux hosts, making the feature compatible with all operating systems.
