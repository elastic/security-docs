[[elastic-defend-8.5]]

== Introducing {elastic-defend} 

The integration that monitors events and provides threat prevention and detection on your hosts has been renamed from *Endpoint and Cloud Security integration* to *{elastic-defend}*. 

[role="screenshot"]

When installing the {elastic-defend} integration, you can now select from several pre-configured use cases, which you can customize as needed. For more information on how to get started, refer to {security-guide}/install-endpoint.html[Configure and install the {elastic-defend} integration].

== Kubernetes and Cloud Security Posture enhancements

*Terminal output collection*

{elastic-defend} can now collect terminal output, which allows {security-guide}/session-view.html[Session View] to provide a complete history of Linux sessions through the terminal output viewer. 

*Test Kubernetes clusters with Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) integration*

In addition to unmanaged clusters, you can now use the KSPM integration to test the security of your Kubernetes clusters managed by Amazon EKS.  


[discrete]
== Detection rules enhancements 

*Enhancements to rule preview* 

You can now {security-guide}/rules-ui-create.html#preview-rules[preview a rule] at any step of creating or editing a rule, and can preview Elastic prebuilt rules. Rule previews also now include exceptions and field overrides.

*Choose the frequency of using saved queries* 

When selecting a saved query to define a rule's query settings, you can now choose whether to use the saved query on every rule execution or to use it once. 

*New bulk edit rule options*

You can now {security-guide}/rules-ui-management.html#edit-rules-settings[bulk edit] rule actions and rule schedules on multiple detection rules. 

*Enhancements to rule exceptions*

There are several enhancements and UI improvements to rule exceptions:

* When {security-guide}/detections-ui-exceptions.html#detection-rule-exceptions[adding a rule exception], you can now create value lists for all rule types. Note that you can't use text type value lists for event correlation and threshold rules. 

* If a rule has or allows endpoint exceptions, there are two exception tabs: the *Rule exceptions* tab and a new *Endpoint exceptions* tab. The *Endpoint exceptions* tab provides an easy way to manage endpoint exceptions.

* You can now check how many other rules are affected by an exception by clicking *Affects _X_ rules* next to an exception list item.

*New prebuilt rules*

28 new {security-guide}/prebuilt-rules.html[prebuilt rules] were added in 8.5.0. 

[discrete]
== Endpoint response enhancements 

*Updated messaging in response console*

The {security-guide}/response-actions.html[response console] UI now displays a message if response action commands aren't supported by an installed version of {agent}, which must be 8.4 or later. 

*Response actions history log for all endpoints*

You can now filter and search endpoint response actions history for an endpoint. In addition, there's now a standalone {security-guide}/response-actions-history.html[Response actions history] page that shows an action log of all endpoints.

== New Entity Analytics dashboard 

The {security-guide}/detection-entity-dashboard.html[Entity Analytics dashboard] provides a centralized view of emerging insider threats - including host risk, user risk, and notable anomalies from within your network. Use it to triage, investigate, and respond to emerging threats. You can also enable host risk score and user risk score directly from this dashboard by clicking the *Enable* button. To learn more, refer to {security-guide}/host-risk-score.html#enable-host-risk-score[Host risk score] and {security-guide}/user-risk-score.html#deploy-user-risk-score[User risk score].

== Alerts enhancements 

*Alert counts displayed on Explore detail pages* 

Each of the Explore detail pages ({security-guide}/hosts-overview.html#host-details-page[host details], {security-guide}/network-page-overview.html#ip-details-page[network details], and {security-guide}/users-page.html#_user_details_page[user details]) now displays alert metrics that show the total number of alerts by severity, rule, and status.  

[role="screenshot"]
image::whats-new/images/8.5/alert-counts.png[Alert count metrics]

*Visual event analyzer enhancements* 

* If you have a http://elastic.co/pricing[Platinum subscription] or higher, by default, you can now examine alerts associated with the event. 

* The visual event analyzer automatically displays the entire process tree if you select a time range that doesn't have any process events. You'll also receive a message that your time range is too narrow. 


*Alert details flyout enhancements* 

The following enhancements have been made to the alert details flyout. To learn more about analyzing detection alerts, refer to {security-guide}/view-alert-details.html[View alert details]. 

* Improvements to the *Overview* tab:
** *Reason statement shown in rendered view* - The alert rendered view displays event details, such as the alert reason statement, file paths, or process arguments, to provide context for the alert. You can take action (such as Add to Timeline) on individual fields in the statement. 
** *Event renderer added to the Overview tab* - The event renderer displays relevant event details to provide context for the alert, such as file paths or process arguments. You can take actions on any of the fields provided.

* If you have a http://elastic.co/pricing[Platinum subscription] or higher, these details are included in the *Insights* section:

** *Alerts related by session ID* - Shows the ten most recent alerts generated during the same session. These alerts share the same session ID, a unique ID for tracking a given Linux session. To use this feature, you must enable the *Include session data* setting in your {security-guide}/install-endpoint.html#add-security-integration[{elastic-defend} integration policy]. 

** *Alerts related by process ancestry* - Shows alerts that are related by process events on the same linear branch. 

** *Risk score data included* - Risk score classification data is displayed in the *Enriched data* section. If the current risk classification has changed from the original, both scores appear to show the difference.

== Indicators page enabled by default 

The Indicators page, which provides a centralized view for threat intelligence analysts to view and investigate indicators of compromise (IoCs), is now enabled by default. To learn more about this feature, refer to {security-guide}/indicators-of-compromise.html[Indicators of compromise]. 

[role="screenshot"]

== Assign users to a case

You can now {security-guide}/cases-open-manage.html#cases-open-manage[assign users to a case] if they meet the necessary prerequisites. 

[discrete]
== Osquery enhancements 

* *Add Osquery results to a case* - After users run Osquery from an alert, they can add Osquery results to a new or an existing case. 

* *Use Osquery Response Action to query hosts* - Users can use the Osquery Response Action to immediately query hosts that generate alerts. Note that Response Actions are currently a technical preview feature. 

* *Run Osquery queries from an investigation guide* -  When analyzing an alert, you can now add queries to a rule's investigation guide and run it as part of your investigation.
