There's a {security-guide}/prebuilt-rules-management.html[newly redesigned UI] and workflow for managing prebuilt detection rules to allow more flexibility and visibility into rule updates.

In addition, prebuilt detection rules have new tags to categorize your rules, such as the rule’s purpose, detection method, associated resources, and other information.

=== Monitor rule performance with the new Detection rule monitoring dashboard

The {security-guide}/rule-monitoring-dashboard.html[Detection rule monitoring dashboard] provides visualizations to help you monitor the overall health and performance of {elastic-sec}'s detection rules. Review this dashboard for a high-level overview to determine if your rules are running successfully and how long they’re taking to run, search data, and create alerts.
