== Configure external connections

You can push {es-sec} cases to these third-party systems:

* {sn-itsm}
* {sn-sir}
* {jira} (including Jira Service Desk)
* {ibm-r}
* {swimlane}
* {webhook-cm}

To push cases, you need to create a connector, which stores the information required to interact with an external system. After you have created a connector, you can set {es-sec} cases to automatically close when they are sent to external systems.

IMPORTANT: To create connectors and send cases to external systems, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license], and your role needs *All* privileges for the *Action and Connectors* feature. For more information, refer to <<case-permissions>>.

. Enter your required settings. For connector configuration details, refer to:

[[mapped-case-fields]]
=== Mapped case fields

To represent an {elastic-sec} case in an external system, case fields are mapped to existing fields in {sn}, {jira}, {ibm-r}, and {swimlane}. Once fields are mapped, you can push updates to external systems and mapped fields are overwritten or appended. Retrieving data from external systems is not supported.

|===

| *Case field* | *Mapped field*

| Title

a| The case `Title` field is mapped to corresponding fields in external systems. Mapped field values are overwritten when you push updates.

* *{sn}*: Mapped to the `Short description` field.
* *{jira}*: Mapped to the `Summary` field.
* *{ibm-r}*: Mapped to the `Name` field.
* *{swimlane}*: Mapped to the `Description` field.

| Description
| The case `Description` field is mapped to the `Description` field in {sn}, {jira}, {ibm-r}, and {swimlane}. Mapped field values are overwritten when you push updates.

| Comments

a| For {sn} connctors, the case `Comments` field is mapped to the `Work Notes` field in {sn}.

For {jira}, {ibm-r}, and {swimlane} connectors, the case `Comments` field is mapped to the `Comments` field in {jira}, {ibm-r}, and {swimlane}.

New and edited comments are added to incident records when pushed to {sn}, {jira}, or {ibm-r}. Comments pushed to {swimlane} are appended to the `Comment` field in {swimlane} and posted individually.
