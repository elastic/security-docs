== Configure external connections

You can push {es-sec} cases to these third-party systems:

* {sn-itsm}
* {sn-sir}
* {jira} (including Jira Service Desk)
* {ibm-r}
* {swimlane}

To push cases, you need to create a connector, which stores the information required to interact with an external system. After you have created a connector, you can set {es-sec} cases to automatically close when they are sent to external systems.

IMPORTANT: To create connectors and send cases to external systems, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license], and your role needs *All* privileges for the *Action and Connectors* feature. For more information, refer to <<case-permissions>>.

[[create-new-connector]]
=== Create a new connector

. Go to *Investigate* -> *Cases* -> *Edit external connection*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/cases-ui-connector.png[Shows the page for creating connectors]
. From the *Incident management system* list, select *Add new connector*.
. Select the system to send cases to: *{sn}*, *{jira}*, *{ibm-r}*, or *{swimlane}*.

+
IMPORTANT: If you've upgraded from {stack} version 7.15.0 or earlier to 7.16.0 or later, you must complete several prerequisites before creating a new {sn-itsm} or {sn-sir} connector. For more information, refer to prerequisites for {kibana-ref}/servicenow-action-type.html#servicenow-itsm-connector-prerequisites[{sn-itsm}] and {kibana-ref}/servicenow-sir-action-type.html#servicenow-sir-connector-prerequisites[{sn-sir}].

. Enter your required settings.

| *All* | You can choose to set all or no field mappings when creating your new {swimlane} connector. However, note that if
you don’t set field mappings now, you’ll be prompted to do so if you want to use the connector for a case or a rule.

| *Alerts* | Provide an alert ID and rule name.

| *Cases* | Provide a case ID, a case name, comments, and a description.

[[mapped-case-fields]]
=== Mapped case fields

To represent an {es-sec} case in an external system, {es-sec} case fields are
mapped as follows:

NOTE: Data from mapped case fields can be pushed to external systems but cannot be pulled in.

* For {sn} incidents:
+
|===

| *Title* | Mapped to the {sn} `Short description` field. When an update to a case title is sent to {sn}, the existing {sn} `Short description` field is overwritten.

| *Description* | Mapped to the {sn} `Description` field. When an update to a case description is sent to {sn}, the existing {sn} `Description` field is overwritten.

| *Comments* | Mapped to the {sn} `Work Notes` field. When a comment is updated in a case, a new comment is added to the {sn} incident.

|===
+

* For {jira} issues:
+
|===

| *Title* | Mapped to the {jira} `Summary` field. When an update to a case title is sent to {jira}, the existing {jira} `Summary` field is overwritten.

| *Description* | Mapped to the {jira} `Description` field. When an update to a case description is sent to {jira}, the existing {jira} `Description` field is overwritten.

| *Comments* | Mapped to the {jira} `Comments` field. When a comment is updated in a case, a new comment is added to the {jira} incident.

|===
+

* For {ibm-r} issues:
+
|===

| *Title* | Mapped to the {ibm-r} `Name` field. When an update to a case title is sent to {ibm-r}, the existing {ibm-r} `Name` field is overwritten.

| *Description* | Mapped to the {ibm-r} `Description` field. When an update to a case description is sent to {ibm-r}, the existing {ibm-r} `Description` field is overwritten.

| *Comments* | Mapped to the {ibm-r} `Comments` field. When a comment is updated in a case, a new comment is added to the {ibm-r} incident.

|===
+

* For {swimlane} records:
+
|===

| *Title* | Mapped to the {swimlane} `caseName` field. When an update to a case title is sent to {swimlane}, the field that is mapped to the {swimlane} `caseName` field is
overwritten.

| *Description* | Mapped to the {swimlane} `Description` field. When an update to a case description is sent to {swimlane}, the field that is mapped to the {swimlane} `Description` field is overwritten.

| *Comments* | Mapped to the {swimlane} `Comments` field. When a new comment is added to a case, or an existing one is updated, the field that is mapped to the {swimlane} `Comment` field is appended. Comments are posted to the {swimlane} incident record individually.
