== Configuring external connections

You can push {es-sec} cases to these third-party systems and set the:

* {sn}: Urgency, severity, and impact.
* Jira (including Jira Service Desk): Issue type (except epics), priority, and parent issue for subtasks.
* {ibm-r}: Issue type and severity

To push cases, you need to create a connector, which stores the information
required to interface with an external system.

After you have created a connector, you can set {es-sec} cases to
automatically close when they are sent to external systems.

NOTE: To create connectors and send cases to external systems, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license].

=== Create a new connector

. Go to *Security* -> *Cases* -> *Edit external connection*.

. From the `Incident management system` list, select `Add new connector`.
. Select one of these:
* {sn}: To send cases to {sn}
* Jira: To send cases to Jira or Jira Service Desk
* {ibm-r}: To send cases to {ibm-r}

. Fill in the following:
* _Connector name_: A name for the connector.
* _URL_: The URL of the external system to which you want to send cases.
* _Organization ID_ ({ibm-r} connectors only): Your organization's {ibm-r} ID
number.
* _Username_ ({sn} connectors only): The username of the {sn} account used to
access the {sn} instance.
* _Password_ ({sn} connectors only): The password of the {sn} account used to access the {sn} instance.
* _Project key_ (Jira connectors only): The key of the Jira project to which
you are sending cases.
* _Email or Username_ (Jira connectors only): The Jira account's username or email address.
* _API token or Password_ (Jira connectors only): The API token or password used
to authenticate Jira updates.
* _API key ID_ ({ibm-r} connectors only): The API key used to authenticate
{ibm-r} updates.
* _API key secret_ ({ibm-r} connectors only): The API key secret used to
authenticate {ibm-r} updates.

. Save the connector.

To represent an {es-sec} case in an external system, {es-sec} case fields are
mapped as follows:

* For {sn} incidents:
** `Title`: Mapped to the {sn} `Short description` field. When an update to a
Security case title is sent to {sn}, the existing {sn} `Short description`
field is overwritten.
** `Description`: Mapped to the {sn} `Description` field. When an update to a
Security case description is sent to {sn}, the existing {sn} `Description`
field is overwritten.
** `Comments`: Mapped to the {sn} `Comments` field. When a comment is updated
in a Security case, a new comment is added to the {sn} incident.
* For Jira issues:
** `Issue type`: Mapped to the Jira `Issue Type` field. This can be set to `Task`, `Story`, `Bug`, or `Subtask` (requires a parent issue).
** `Title`: Mapped to the Jira `Summary` field. When an update to a
Security case title is sent to Jira, the existing Jira `Summary` field is
overwritten.
** `Description`: Mapped to the Jira `Description` field. When an update to a
Security case description is sent to Jira, the existing Jira `Description`
field is overwritten.
** `Comments`: Mapped to the Jira `Comments` field. When a comment is updated
in a Security case, a new comment is added to the Jira incident.
* For {ibm-r} issues:
** `Title`: Mapped to the {ibm-r} `Name` field. When an update to a
Security case title is sent to {ibm-r}, the existing {ibm-r} `Name` field is
overwritten.
** `Description`: Mapped to the {ibm-r} `Description` field. When an update to a
Security case description is sent to {ibm-r}, the existing {ibm-r} `Description`
field is overwritten.
** `Comments`: Mapped to the {ibm-r} `Comments` field. When a comment is updated
in a Security case, a new comment is added to the {ibm-r} incident.

=== Close sent cases automatically

To close cases when they are sent to an external system, select
_Automatically close Security cases when pushing new incident to external system_.

[float]
=== Change and update connectors

You can create additional connectors, update existing connectors, and change
the connector used to send cases to external systems.

TIP: You can also configure which connector is used for each case individually
(see <<cases-ui-open>>). 

. To change the default connector used to send cases to external systems: 
.. Go to *Security* -> *Cases* -> *Edit external connection*.
.. Select the required connector from the `Incident management system` list.
. To update an existing connector:
.. Click `Update <connector name>`.
.. Update the connector fields as required.
