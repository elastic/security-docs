== Configure external connections

You can push {es-sec} cases to these third-party systems:

* {sn-itsm}
* {sn-sir}
* {jira} (including Jira Service Desk)
* {ibm-r}
* {swimlane}
* {webhook-cm}

To push cases, you need to create a connector, which stores the information required to interact with an external system. After you have created a connector, you can set {es-sec} cases to automatically close when they are sent to external systems.

IMPORTANT: To create connectors and send cases to external systems, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license], and your role needs *All* privileges for the *Action and Connectors* feature. For more information, refer to <<case-permissions>>.
