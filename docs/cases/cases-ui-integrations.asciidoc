== Configure external connections
:frontmatter-description: Create and add external connectors to send cases to third-party systems.
:frontmatter-tags-products: [security] 
:frontmatter-tags-content-type: [how-to] 
:frontmatter-tags-user-goals: [analyze]

You can push {elastic-sec} cases to these third-party systems:

* {sn-itsm}
* {sn-sir}
* {jira} (including Jira Service Desk)
* {ibm-r}
* {swimlane}
* {webhook-cm}

To push cases, you need to create a connector, which stores the information required to interact with an external system. After you have created a connector, you can set {elastic-sec} cases to automatically close when they are sent to external systems.

IMPORTANT: To create connectors and send cases to external systems, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license], and your role needs *All* privileges for the *Action and Connectors* feature. For more information, refer to <<case-permissions>>.

[[mapped-case-fields]]
=== Mapped case fields

When you export an {elastic-sec} case to an external system, case fields are mapped to existing fields in {sn}, {jira}, {ibm-r}, and {swimlane}. For the {webhook-cm} connector, case fields can be mapped to custom or pre-existing fields in the external system you're connecting to.

Once fields are mapped, you can push updates to external systems, and mapped fields are overwritten or appended. Retrieving data from external systems is not supported.

|===

| *Case field* | *Mapped field*

| Title

a| The case `Title` field is mapped to corresponding fields in external systems. Mapped field values are overwritten when you push updates.

* *{sn}*: `Short description`
* *{jira}*: `Summary`
* *{ibm-r}*: `Name`
* *{swimlane}*: `Description`

| Description
| The case `Description` field is mapped to the `Description` field in all systems. Mapped field values are overwritten when you push updates.

| Comments

a| The case `Comments` field is mapped to corresponding fields in external systems.

* *{sn}*: `Work Notes`
* *{jira}*: `Comments`
* *{ibm-r}*: `Comments`
* *{swimlane}*: `Comments`

New and edited comments are added to incident records when pushed to {sn}, {jira}, or {ibm-r}. Comments pushed to {swimlane} are appended to the `Comment` field in {swimlane} and posted individually.
