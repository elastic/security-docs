== Configure external connections

You can push {es-sec} cases to these third-party systems:

* {sn} ITSM
* {sn} SecOps
* {jira} (including Jira Service Desk)
* {ibm-r}
* {swimlane}

To push cases, you need to create a connector, which stores the information
required to interact with an external system.

After you have created a connector, you can set {es-sec} cases to
automatically close when they are sent to external systems.

NOTE: To create connectors and send cases to external systems, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license] and your role needs *All* privileges for the *Action and Connectors* feature. For more information, see <<case-permissions>>.

=== Create a new connector

. Go to *Cases* -> *Edit external connection*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/cases-ui-connector.png[]
. From the *Incident management system* list, select *Add new connector*.
. Select one of these:
* *{sn}*: To send cases to {sn}
* *{jira}*: To send cases to {jira} or Jira Service Desk
* *{ibm-r}*: To send cases to {ibm-r}
* *{swimlane}*: To send cases to {swimlane}

. Fill in the following:
* *Connector name*: A name for the connector.
* *URL*: The URL of the external system to which you want to send cases.
* *API Url* ({swimlane} connectors only): The URL of the {swimlane} instance to which you want to send cases.
* *Organization ID* ({ibm-r} connectors only): Your organization's {ibm-r} ID
number.
* *Application ID* ({swimlane} connectors only): The application ID of your {swimlane} application. From {swimlane}, you can find the application ID by checking your application's settings or at the end of your application's URL after you've opened it.
* *Username* ({sn} connectors only): The username of the {sn} account used to
access the {sn} instance.
* *Password* ({sn} connectors only): The password of the {sn} account used to access the {sn} instance.
* *Project key* ({jira} connectors only): The key of the {jira} project to which
you are sending cases.
* *Email or Username* ({jira} connectors only): The {jira} account's username or email address.
* *API token or Password* ({jira} connectors only): The API token or password used
to authenticate {jira} updates.
* *API key ID* ({ibm-r} connectors only): The API key used to authenticate
{ibm-r} updates.
* *API key secret* ({ibm-r} connectors only): The API key secret used to
authenticate {ibm-r} updates.
* *API token* ({swimlane} connectors only): The {swimlane} API authentication token used for HTTP Basic authentication. This is the personal access token for your user role.

. Choose the connector type (for {swimlane} connectors only):
** *All*: You can choose to set all or no field mappings when creating your new {swimlane} connector. However, note that if you don't set field mappings now, you'll be prompted to do so if you want to use the connector for a case or a rule. The prompts no longer display once you set up the required mappings.
** *Alerts*: Provide an alert ID and rule name.
** *Cases*: Provide a case ID, a case name, comments, and a description.

. Save the connector.

To represent an {es-sec} case in an external system, {es-sec} case fields are
mapped as follows:

NOTE: Data from mapped case fields can be pushed to external systems but cannot be pulled in.

* For {sn} incidents:
** *Title*: Mapped to the {sn} `Short description` field. When an update to a
Security case title is sent to {sn}, the existing {sn} `Short description`
field is overwritten.
** *Description*: Mapped to the {sn} `Description` field. When an update to a
Security case description is sent to {sn}, the existing {sn} `Description`
field is overwritten.
** *Comments*: Mapped to the {sn} `Comments` field. When a comment is updated
in a Security case, a new comment is added to the {sn} incident.
* For {jira} issues:
** *Title*: Mapped to the {jira} `Summary` field. When an update to a
Security case title is sent to {jira}, the existing {jira} `Summary` field is
overwritten.
** *Description*: Mapped to the {jira} `Description` field. When an update to a
Security case description is sent to {jira}, the existing {jira} `Description`
field is overwritten.
** *Comments*: Mapped to the {jira} `Comments` field. When a comment is updated
in a Security case, a new comment is added to the {jira} incident.
* For {ibm-r} issues:
** *Title*: Mapped to the {ibm-r} `Name` field. When an update to a
Security case title is sent to {ibm-r}, the existing {ibm-r} `Name` field is
overwritten.
** *Description*: Mapped to the {ibm-r} `Description` field. When an update to a
Security case description is sent to {ibm-r}, the existing {ibm-r} `Description`
field is overwritten.
** *Comments*: Mapped to the {ibm-r} `Comments` field. When a comment is updated
in a Security case, a new comment is added to the {ibm-r} incident.
* For {swimlane} records:
** *Title*: Mapped to the {swimlane} `caseName` field. When an update to a
Security case title is sent to {swimlane}, the field that is mapped to the {swimlane} `caseName` field is
overwritten.
** *Description*: Mapped to the {swimlane} `Description` field. When an update to a
Security case description is sent to {swimlane}, the field that is mapped to the {swimlane} `Description`
field is overwritten.
** *Comments*: Mapped to the {swimlane} `Comments` field. When a comment is updated
in a Security case, the field that is mapped to the {swimlane} `Comment` field is overwritten.

=== Close sent cases automatically

To close cases when they are sent to an external system, select
*Automatically close Security cases when pushing new incident to external system*.

[float]
=== Change and update connectors

You can create additional connectors, update existing connectors, and change
the connector used to send cases to external systems.

TIP: You can also configure which connector is used for each case individually
(see <<cases-ui-open>>).

. To change the default connector used to send cases to external systems:
.. Go to *Cases* -> *Edit external connection*.
.. Select the required connector from the *Incident management system* list.
. To update an existing connector:
.. Click *Update <connector name>*.
.. Update the connector fields as required.
