[[indicators-of-compromise]]
= Indicators of compromise

The Indicators page (*Intelligence -> Indicators*) collects data from enabled threat intelligence feeds and provides a centralized view of indicators, also known as indicators of compromise (IoCs). This topic helps you set up the Indicators page and explains how to work with IoCs.

.Requirements

* The Indicators page is an https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Enterprise subscription] feature.
* You must have _one_ of the following installed on the hosts you want to monitor:
** *{agent}* - Install a {fleet-guide}/install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent.html[{fleet}-managed {agent}] and ensure the agent's status is `Healthy`. Refer to {fleet-guide}/fleet-troubleshooting.html[{fleet} Troubleshooting] if it isn't.
** *{filebeat}* - Install {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-installation-configuration.html[{filebeat}] version 8.x or later. Earlier {filebeat} versions are incompatible with ECS and will prevent indicator data from displaying in the Indicators table.

[[ti-indicators]]
== Threat intelligence and indicators
Threat intelligence is a research function that analyzes current and emerging threats and recommends appropriate actions to strengthen a company's security posture. Threat intelligence requires proactivity to be useful, such as gathering, analyzing, and investigating various threat and vulnerability data sources.

An indicator, also referred to as an IoC, is a piece of information associated with a known threat or reported vulnerability. There are many types of indicators, including URLs, files, domains, email addresses, and more. Within SOC teams, threat intelligence analysts use indicators to detect, assess, and respond to threats.

[[setup-indicators-page]]
== Set up the Indicators page

Install a threat intelligence integration to add indicators to the Indicators page.


. Choose one of the following:
* From the {security-app} main menu, go to *Intelligence* -> *Indicators* -> *Add Integrations*.
* From the {kib} main menu, click *Add integrations*. Scroll down the list of integration categories and select *Threat Intelligence* to filter by threat intelligence integrations.
. Select a threat intelligence integration, then complete the integration's guided installation.
+
NOTE: For more information about available fields, go to the https://docs.elastic.co/integrations[Elastic integration documentation] and search for a specific threat intelligence integration.

. Return to the Indicators page in {elastic-sec}. Refresh the page if indicator data isn't displaying.

[[troubleshoot-indicators-page]]
=== Troubleshooting
If indicator data is not appearing in the Indicators table after you installed a threat intelligence integration:

* Verify that the index storing indicator documents is included in the <<update-sec-indices,default {elastic-sec} indices>> (`securitySolution:defaultIndex`). The index storing indicator documents will differ based on the way you're collecting indicator data:
** *{agent} integrations* - `logs_ti*`
** *{filebeat} integrations* - `filebeat-*`
* Ensure the indicator data you're ingesting is mapped to {ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)].

[[intelligence-page-ui]]
== Indicators page UI

After you add indicators to the Indicators page, you can <<examine-indicator-details, examine>>, search, filter, and take action on indicator data. Indicators also appear in the Trend view, which shows the total values in the legend.

[[examine-indicator-details]]
=== Examine indicator details
Learn more about an indicator by clicking *View details*, then opening the Indicator details flyout. The flyout contains these informational tabs:

* *Overview*: A summary of the indicator, including the indicator's name, the threat intelligence feed it came from, the indicator type, and additional relevant data.
+
NOTE: Some threat intelligence feeds provide  https://www.cisa.gov/tlp#:~:text=Introduction,shared%20with%20the%20appropriate%20audience[Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) markings]. The `TLP Marking` and `Confidence` fields will be empty if the feed doesn't provide that data.

* *Table*: The indicator data in table format.
* *JSON*: The indicator data in JSON format.

[[find-related-sec-events]]
== Find related security events

Investigating an indicator in <<timelines-ui,Timeline>> helps you find related security events in your environment. You can add an indicator to Timeline from the Indicators table or the Indicator details flyout.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/indicator-in-timeline.png[Shows the results of an indicator being investigated in Timeline]

When you add an indicator to Timeline, a new Timeline opens with a pre-populated KQL query. The query contains the indicator field-value pair that you selected plus the field-value pair of the mapped source event.

For example, imagine you've added this file hash indicator to Timeline:

`threat.indicator.file.hash.sha256 : c207213257a63589b1e1bd2f459b47becd000c1af8ea7983dd9541aff145c3ba`

A new Timeline opens with an automatically populated KQL query. The query contains the indicator field-value pair (mentioned previously) and the mapped source event field-value pair, which is:

`file.hash.sha256 : c207213257a63589b1e1bd2f459b47becd000c1af8ea7983dd9541aff145c3ba`.

Using a KQL query that includes both the indicator and source event allows Timeline to find all events and alerts that have matching field-value pairs.

[[attach-indicator-to-case]]
== Attach indicators to cases

Attaching indicators to cases provides more context and available actions for your investigations. This feature allows you to easily share or escalate threat intelligence to other teams.

To add indicators to cases:

. From the Indicators table, click the *More actions menu* (*...​*). Alternatively, open an indicator's details, then select *Take action*.
. Select one of the following:
+
--
* *Add to existing case*: From the *Select case* dialog box, select the case to which you want to attach the indicator. 
* *Add to new case*: Configure the case details. Refer to <<cases-ui-open>> to learn more about opening a new case. 
--

[[add-indicator-to-blocklists]]
== Add indicators to blocklists

Add indicators to blocklists to prevent selected applications from running on your hosts. When creating a blocklist, you can add indicators that have hash values for the MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256 fields and are of the `file` indicator type.

.Requirements
[sidebar]
--
* In addition to configuring specific entries on the **Blocklist** page, you must also ensure that the blocklist is enabled on the {elastic-defend} integration policy in the <<malware-protection, Malware protection settings>>. This setting is enabled by default.

* You must have the `superuser` {ref}/built-in-roles.html[built-in user role] to access this feature.
--

To add an indicator to a blocklist:

. From the Indicators table, click the *More actions menu* (*...​*) menu, then select *Add blocklist entry*. Alternatively, open an indicator's details, then select *Take action > Add blocklist entry*. The *Add blocklist* flyout opens.

. Fill in these fields in the **Details** section:
.. `Name`: Enter a name to identify the indictor in the blocklist.
.. `Description`: Enter a description to provide more information on the blocklist entry (optional).

. In the **Conditions** section, verify that information about the indicator is correct.

. Select an option in the *Assignment* section to assign the blocklist entry to a specific integration policy:
+
* `Global`: Assign the blocklist entry to all {elastic-defend} integration policies.
* `Per Policy`: Assign the blocklist entry to one or more specific {elastic-defend} integration policies. Select each policy where you want the blocklist entry to apply.
+
NOTE: You can also select the `Per Policy` option without immediately assigning a policy to the blocklist entry. For example, you could do this to create and review your blocklist configurations before putting them into action with a policy.

. Click **Add blocklist**. The new entry is added to the **Blocklist** page.

. When you're done adding entries to the blocklist, ensure that the blocklist is enabled for the {elastic-defend} integration policies that you just assigned:
.. Go to **Manage** -> **Policies**, then click on an integration policy.
.. On the **Policy settings** tab, ensure that the **Malware protections enabled** and **Blocklist enabled** toggles are switched on. Both settings are enabled by default.
