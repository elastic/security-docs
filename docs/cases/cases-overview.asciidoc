:frontmatter-description: Cases enable you to track investigation details about security issues.
:frontmatter-tags-products: [security] 
:frontmatter-tags-content-type: [overview] 
:frontmatter-tags-user-goals: [analyze]

Collect and share information about security issues by opening a case in {elastic-sec}. Cases allow you to track key investigation details, collect alerts in a central location, and more. The {elastic-sec} UI provides several ways to create and manage cases. Alternatively, you can use the {api-kibana}/group/endpoint-cases[cases API] to perform the same tasks.

You can also send cases to these external systems by <<cases-ui-integrations, configuring external connectors>>:

* {sn-itsm}
* {sn-sir}
* {jira} (including Jira Service Desk)
* {ibm-r}
* {swimlane}
* {webhook-cm}
