[[cases-overview]]
= Cases

Collect and share information about security issues by opening a case in {elastic-sec}. Cases allow you to track key investigation details, collect alerts in a central location, and more. The {elastic-sec} UI provides several ways to create and manage cases. Alternatively, you can use the <<cases-api-overview,cases API>> to perform the same tasks.

You can also send cases to these external systems by <<cases-ui-integrations, configuring external connectors>>:

* {sn-itsm}
* {sn-sir}
* {jira} (including Jira Service Desk)
* {ibm-r}
* {swimlane}
* {webhook-cm}
