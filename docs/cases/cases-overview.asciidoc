= Cases

Cases are used to open and track security issues directly in the {es-sec-app}.
All cases list the original reporter and all users who contribute to a case
(`participants`). Comments support Markdown syntax and allow linking to saved <<timelines-ui,Timelines>>. Additionally, you can send cases to these
external systems from within {es-sec}:

* {sn} ITSM
* {sn} SecOps
* {jira} (including Jira Service Desk)
* {ibm-r}
* {swimlane}

<<cases-ui-integrations>> describes how to set up external integrations. When configuring case fields, note that data from mapped fields can be pushed to external systems but cannot be pulled in.

You can create and manage cases using the UI or the <<cases-api-overview>>.

IMPORTANT: To send cases to external systems, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license] and your role needs *All* privileges for the *Action and Connectors* feature. For information about the base role privileges you need to access cases, refer to <<case-permissions>>.

NOTE: From {elastic-sec}, you cannot access cases created in {observability} or Stack Management.

[[cases-ui-open]]
== Open a new case

Open a new case to keep track of security issues and share their details with
colleagues.

. Go to *Investigate* -> *Cases*, then click *Create case*. If no cases exist, the Cases table will be empty and you'll be prompted to create one by clicking the *Create case* button inside the table.
. Give the case a name, and add a description and any relevant tags.
+
TIP: In the `Description` area, you can use
https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet[Markdown] syntax and insert a
timeline link (click the icon in the top right corner of the area).

. Choose whether you want alert statuses to sync with the case's status after they are added to the case. This option is enabled by default, but you can still turn it off after creating the case.
. When ready, create the case.
. If external connections are configured, you can:
* Select which connector is used to send the case to an external system
(`External incident management system`).
* Send the case to an external system. You can send the case to more than one
external system.

[[cases-ui-manage]]
== Manage existing cases

From the Cases page, you can search existing cases and filter them by tags, reporter, and status
(open, in-progress, or closed).

To explore a case, click on its name. You can then:

* <<cases-summary>>
* Add a new comment
* <<cases-lens-visualization>>
* Edit existing comments and the case's description
* Add a connector (if you did not select one while creating the case)
* Send updates to external systems (if external connections are configured)
* Close the case
* Reopen a closed case
* Edit tags
* Refresh the case to retrieve the latest updates

NOTE: Comments can also contain Markdown syntax and Timeline links.

[float]
[[cases-summary]]
== Review the case summary

Click on an existing case to access the case summary. The case summary, located under the case title, contains metrics that summarize alert information and response times. These metrics update when you attach additional unique alerts to the case, add more connectors, or modify the case's status:

* **Total alerts**: Total number of unique alerts attached to the case.
* **Associated users**: Total number of unique users that are represented in the attached alerts.
* **Associated hosts**: Total number of unique hosts that are represented in the attached alerts.
* **Total connectors**: Total number of connectors that have been added to the case.
* **Case created**: Date and time that the case was created.
* **Open duration**: Time elapsed since the case was created.
* **In progress duration**: How long the case has been in the `In progress` state.
* **Duration from creation to close**: Time elapsed from when the case was created to when it was closed.

[[cases-lens-visualization]]
== Add a Lens visualization

beta[]

Add a Lens visualization to your case to portray event and alert data through charts and graphs.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/add-vis-to-case.gif[Shows how to add a visualization to a case]

To add a Lens visualization to a comment within your case:

. Click the *Visualization* button. The Add visualization dialog appears. 
. Select an existing visualization from your Visualize Library or create a new visualization.

+

IMPORTANT: Set an absolute time range for your visualization. This ensures your visualization doesn't change over time after you save it to your case, and provides important context for others managing the case.

+
. Save the visualization to your Visualize Library by clicking the *Save to library* button (optional).
.. Enter a title and description for the visualization. 
.. Choose whether you want to keep the *Update panel on Security* activated. This option is activated by default and automatically adds the visualization to your Visualize Library.
. After you've finished creating your visualization, click *Save and return* to go back to your case.
. Click *Preview* to show how the visualization will appear in the case comment.
. Click *Add Comment* to add the visualization to your case. 

NOTE: Once a visualization has been added to a case, it cannot be modified or deleted. However, you can interact with the visualization by clicking the *Open Visualization* option in the comment menu.

[[cases-export-import]]
== Export and import cases

Cases can be <<cases-export, exported>> and <<cases-import, imported>> as saved objects through the Kibana {kibana-ref}/managing-saved-objects.html[Saved Objects] UI.

IMPORTANT: Before importing Lens visualizations, Timelines, or alerts into a space, ensure their data is present. Without it, they won't work after being imported.

[float]
[[cases-export]]
=== Export a case
Use the *Export* option to move cases between different Kibana instances. When you export a case, the following data is exported to a newline-delimited JSON (`.ndjson`) file: case details, user actions, text string comments, case alerts, and lens visualizations (which are exported as JSON blobs).

To export a case:

. Open the main menu, click *Stack Management -> Kibana*, then select the *Saved Objects* tab.
. Search for the case by choosing a saved object type or entering the case title in the search bar.
. Select one or more cases, then click the *Export* button.
. Click *Export*. A confirmation message that your file is downloading displays.

+
TIP: Keep the *Include related objects* option enabled to ensure connectors are exported too.

[float]
[[cases-import]]
=== Import a case

To import a case:

. Open the main menu, click *Stack Management -> Kibana* and then select the *Saved Objects* tab.
. Click *Import*.
. Select the NDJSON file containing the exported case and configure the import options.
. Click *Import*.
. Review the import log and click *Done*.
+
[IMPORTANT]
=========================

Be mindful of the following:

* If the imported case had connectors attached to it, you'll be prompted to re-authenticate the connectors. To do so, click *Go to connectors* on the *Import saved objects* flyout and complete the necessary steps. Alternatively, open the main menu, then go to *Stack Management -> Alerts and Insights -> Rules and Connectors -> Connectors* to access connectors.
* If the imported case had attached alerts, verify that the alerts’ source documents are present in the environment. Case features that interact with alerts (such as the Alert Details flyout and rule details page) rely on the alerts’ source documents to function.
