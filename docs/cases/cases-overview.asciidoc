= Cases

Cases are used to open and track security issues directly in the {es-sec-app}. You can create and manage cases using the UI or the <<cases-api-overview>>.

All cases list the original reporter and all users who contribute to a case
(`participants`). Comments support Markdown syntax and allow linking to saved <<timelines-ui,Timelines>>. You can also send cases to these
external systems by <<cases-ui-integrations, configuring external connectors>>:

* {sn} ITSM
* {sn} SecOps
* {jira} (including Jira Service Desk)
* {ibm-r}
* {swimlane}
