= Cases (beta)

beta[]

Cases are used to open and track security issues directly in the {es-sec-app}. 
All cases list the original reporter and all users who contribute to a case
(`participants`). Comments support Markdown syntax, and allow linking to saved <<timelines-ui,Timelines>>. Additionally, you can send cases to these
external systems from within {es-sec}:

* {sn}
* {jira} (including Jira Service Desk)
* {ibm-r}

<<cases-ui-integrations>> describes how to set up external integrations.

You can create and manage cases via the UI or the <<cases-api-overview>>.

NOTE: To send cases to external systems, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license].

IMPORTANT: To make sure you can view and open cases, see <<case-permissions>>.

* Edit existing comments and the case's description.
* Send updates to external systems (if external connections are configured).
* Close the case.
* Reopen a closed case.
* Edit tags.
* Refresh the case to retrieve the latest updates.
