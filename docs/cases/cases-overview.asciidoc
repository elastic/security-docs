= Cases

Cases are used to open and track security issues directly in the {es-sec-app}.
All cases list the original reporter and all users who contribute to a case
(`participants`). Comments support Markdown syntax and allow linking to saved <<timelines-ui,Timelines>>. Additionally, you can send cases to these
external systems from within {es-sec}:

* {sn} ITSM
* {sn} SecOps
* {jira} (including Jira Service Desk)
* {ibm-r}
* {swimlane}

<<cases-ui-integrations>> describes how to set up external integrations. When configuring case fields, note that data from mapped fields can be pushed to external systems but cannot be pulled in.

You can create and manage cases via the UI or the <<cases-api-overview>>.

NOTE: To send cases to external systems, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license] and your role needs *All* privileges for the *Action and Connectors* feature. For information about the base role privileges you need to view or update cases, see <<case-permissions>>.

[[cases-ui-open]]
== Open a new case

Open a new case to keep track of security issues and share their details with
colleagues.

. Go to *Cases* -> *Create new case*.
. Give the case a name, and add a description and any relevant tags.
+
TIP: In the `Description` area, you can use
https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet[Markdown] syntax and insert a
timeline link (click the icon in the top right corner of the area).

. Choose whether you want alert statuses to sync with the case's status after they are added to the case. This option is enabled by default, but you can still turn it off after creating the case.
. When ready, create the case.
. If external connections are configured, you can:
* Select which connector is used to send the case to an external system
(`External incident management system`).
* Send the case to an external system. You can send the case to more than one
external system.

[[cases-ui-manage]]
== Manage existing cases

You can search existing cases and filter them by tags, reporter, and status
(open, in-progress, or closed).

To view a case, click on its name. You can then:

* Add a new comment
* <<cases-lens-visualization>>
* Edit existing comments and the case's description
* Add a connector (if you did not select one while creating the case)
* Send updates to external systems (if external connections are configured)
* Close the case
* Reopen a closed case
* Edit tags
* Refresh the case to retrieve the latest updates

NOTE: Comments can also contain Markdown syntax and Timeline links.

== Add a Lens visualization

beta[]

Add a Lens visualization to your case to portray event and alert data through charts and graphs.

image::images/add-vis-to-case.gif[Shows how to add a visualization to a case]

To add a Lens visualization to a comment within your case:

. Click the *Visualization* button. The Add visualization dialog appears. 
. Select an existing visualization from your Visualize Library or create a new visualization.

+

IMPORTANT: Set an absolute time range for your visualization. This ensures your visualization doesn't change over time after you save it to your case and provides important context for other viewers.

+
. Save the visualization to your Visualize Library by clicking the *Save to library* button (optional).
.. Enter a title and description for the visualization. 
.. Choose whether you want to keep the *Update panel on Security* activated. This option is activated by default and automatically adds the visualization to your Visualize Library.
. After you've finished creating your visualization, click *Save and return* to go back to your case.
. Click *Preview* to see how the visualization will appear in the case comment.
. Click *Add Comment* to add the visualization to your case. 

NOTE: Once a visualization has been added to a case, it cannot be modified or deleted. However, you can interact with the visualization by clicking the *Open Visualization* option in the comment menu.

[[cases-export-import]]
== Export and import cases

Cases can be <<cases-export, exported>> and <<cases-import, imported>> as saved objects through the Kibana {kibana-ref}/managing-saved-objects.html[Saved Objects] UI.

IMPORTANT: Before importing Lens visualizations, Timelines, or alerts into a space, ensure their data is present. Without it, they won't work after being imported.

[float]
[[cases-export]]
=== Export a case
Use the export option to move cases between different Kibana instances. When you export a case, the following data is exported to a newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON) file: case details, user actions, text string comments, case alerts, and lens visualizations.

NOTE: Exported alerts contain metadata that allow the case to reference the appropriate alerts after they're imported. Lens visualizations are exported as JSON blobs.

To export a case:

. Open the main menu, click *Stack Management -> Kibana*, then select the *Saved Objects* tab.
. Search for the case by choosing a saved object type or entering the case title in the search bar.
. Select one or more cases, then click the *Export* button.
. Click *Export*. A confirmation message that your file is downloading displays.

+
TIP: Keep the *Include related objects* option enabled to ensure connectors are exported too.

[[cases-import]]
=== Import a case

To import a case:

. Open the main menu, click *Stack Management -> Kibana* and then select the *Saved Objects* tab.
. Click *Import*.
. Select the NDJSON file containing the exported case and configure the import options.
. Click *Import*.
. Review the import log and click *Done*.
+
IMPORTANT: If you imported a case with a connector, you'll be prompted to re-authenticate the connector. To do so, click the *Go to connectors* button on the *Import saved objects* flyout and complete the necessary steps to re-authenticate the connector. Another way to access connectors is to open the main menu, then go to *Stack Management -> Alerts and Insights -> Rules and Connectors -> Connectors*.
