[[cases-open-manage]]
= Open and manage cases

You can create and manage cases using the UI or the <<cases-api-overview>>.

[float]
[[cases-ui-open]]
== Open a new case

Open a new case to keep track of security issues and share their details with
colleagues.

. Go to *Cases*, then click *Create case*. If no cases exist, the Cases table will be empty and you'll be prompted to create one by clicking the *Create case* button inside the table.
. Give the case a name, assign a severity level, and provide a description. You can use
https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet[Markdown] syntax in the case description.
+
NOTE: If you do not assign your case a severity level, it will be assigned *Low* by default.

+
TIP: You can insert a Timeline link in the case description by clicking the Timeline icon (image:images/add-timeline-button.png[Timeline icon,17,17]).

. Optionally, add assignees and relevant tags. You can add users only if they
meet the necessary <<case-permissions,prerequisites>>.

. Choose if you want alert statuses to sync with the case's status after they are added to the case. This option is enabled by default, but you can turn it off after creating the case.
. From *External incident management*, select a <<cases-ui-integrations,connector>>. If you've previously added one, that connector displays as the default selection. Otherwise, the default setting is `No connector selected`.
. Click *Create case*.
+
NOTE: If you've selected a connector for the case, the case is automatically pushed to the third-party system it's connected to.

[[cases-ui-manage]]
== Manage existing cases

From the Cases page, you can search existing cases and filter them by assignee,
severity, status, and tags. General case metrics, including how long it takes to
close cases, are provided above the table.

To explore a case, click on its name. You can then:

* <<cases-summary>>
* Add and <<cases-manage-comments, manage comments>>
+
TIP: Comments can contain Markdown. For syntax help, click the Markdown icon (image:images/markdown-icon.png[Click markdown icon,17,17]) in the bottom right of the comment.

* <<cases-examine-alerts,Examine alerts attached to the case>>
* <<cases-lens-visualization>>
* Modify the case's description
* Add or remove assignees
* <<cases-ui-integrations,Manage connectors>> and send updates to external systems (if you've added a connector to the case)
* Close the case or reopen it
* Edit tags
* Update the case's severity
* Remove alerts
* Refresh the case to retrieve the latest updates

[float]
[[cases-summary]]
=== Review the case summary

Click on an existing case to access its summary. The case summary, located under the case title, contains metrics that summarize alert information and response times. These metrics update when you attach additional unique alerts to the case, add connectors, or modify the case's status:

* **Total alerts**: Total number of unique alerts attached to the case
* **Associated users**: Total number of unique users that are represented in the attached alerts
* **Associated hosts**: Total number of unique hosts that are represented in the attached alerts
* **Total connectors**: Total number of connectors that have been added to the case
* **Case created**: Date and time that the case was created
* **Open duration**: Time elapsed since the case was created
* **In progress duration**: How long the case has been in the `In progress` state
* **Duration from creation to close**: Time elapsed from when the case was created to when it was closed

[[cases-lens-visualization]]
=== Add a Lens visualization

beta[]

Add a Lens visualization to your case to portray event and alert data through charts and graphs.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/add-vis-to-case.gif[Shows how to add a visualization to a case]

To add a Lens visualization to a comment within your case:

. Click the *Visualization* button. The **Add visualization** dialog appears. 
. Select an existing visualization from your Visualize Library or create a new visualization.

+

IMPORTANT: Set an absolute time range for your visualization. This ensures your visualization doesn't change over time after you save it to your case, and provides important context for others managing the case.

+
. Save the visualization to your Visualize Library by clicking the *Save to library* button (optional).
.. Enter a title and description for the visualization. 
.. Choose if you want to keep the *Update panel on Security* activated. This option is activated by default and automatically adds the visualization to your Visualize Library.
. After you've finished creating your visualization, click *Save and return* to go back to your case.
. Click *Preview* to show how the visualization will appear in the case comment.
. Click *Add Comment* to add the visualization to your case. 

NOTE: Once a visualization has been added to a case, it cannot be modified or deleted. However, you can interact with the visualization by clicking the *Open Visualization* option in the comment menu.

[[cases-export-import]]
== Export and import cases

Cases can be <<cases-export, exported>> and <<cases-import, imported>> as saved objects using the {kib} {kibana-ref}/managing-saved-objects.html[Saved Objects] UI.

IMPORTANT: Before importing Lens visualizations, Timelines, or alerts into a space, ensure their data is present. Without it, they won't work after being imported.

[float]
[[cases-export]]
=== Export a case
Use the *Export* option to move cases between different Kibana instances. When you export a case, the following data is exported to a newline-delimited JSON (`.ndjson`) file:

* Case details
* User actions
* Text string comments
* Case alerts
* Lens visualizations (exported as JSON blobs).

To export a case:

. Open the main menu, go to *Stack Management -> {kib}*, then select the *Saved Objects* tab.
. Search for the case by choosing a saved object type or entering the case title in the search bar.
. Select one or more cases, then click the *Export* button.
. Click *Export*. A confirmation message that your file is downloading displays.

+
TIP: Keep the *Include related objects* option enabled to ensure connectors are exported too.

[float]
[[cases-import]]
=== Import a case

To import a case:

. Open the main menu, go to *Stack Management -> {kib}*, then select the *Saved Objects* tab.
. Click *Import*.
. Select the NDJSON file containing the exported case and configure the import options.
. Click *Import*.
. Review the import log and click *Done*.
+
[IMPORTANT]
=========================

Be mindful of the following:

* If the imported case had connectors attached to it, you'll be prompted to re-authenticate the connectors. To do so, click *Go to connectors* on the *Import saved objects* flyout and complete the necessary steps. Alternatively, open the main menu, then go to *Stack Management -> Alerts and Insights -> Rules and Connectors -> Connectors* to access connectors.
* If the imported case had attached alerts, verify that the alerts’ source documents exist in the environment. Case features that interact with alerts (such as the Alert details flyout and rule details page) rely on the alerts’ source documents to function.
