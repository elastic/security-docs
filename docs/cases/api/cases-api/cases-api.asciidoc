== Cases API

You can create, manage, configure, and send cases to external systems with these APIs:

NOTE: Console supports only Elasticsearch APIs. Console doesn't allow interactions with {kib} APIs. You must use `curl` or another HTTP tool instead. For more information, refer to {kibana-ref}/console-kibana.html[Run {es} API requests].

NOTE: Cases return a warning header for deprecated endpoints. The value of the warning header is in the form `299 Kibana-{kibana_version} "{warning_text}"`

* {kibana-ref}/cases-api.html[Cases API]: Used to open and manage security action items.

* Actions API: Used to send cases to external systems. <<register-connector>>
stores the data required to interface with third-party systems, and
<<cases-actions-api-execute>> sends {es-sec} cases to external systems.
