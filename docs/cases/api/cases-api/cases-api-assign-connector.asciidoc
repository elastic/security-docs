[[assign-connector]]
=== Set default {es-sec-ui} connector

Sets the default connector in the {es-sec-ui}.

NOTE: The {kib} Console supports only Elasticsearch APIs. Console doesn't allow interactions with {kib} APIs. You must use `curl` or another HTTP tool instead. For more information, refer to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/console-kibana.html[Console].

Connectors are used to interface with external systems. You can only call this
method after you have created a connector (see <<register-connector>>). After a
connector has been created and assigned, call <<cases-actions-api-execute>> to
send cases to the external system.

NOTE: You can also set the default connector in the {es-sec-ui} for each case
individually (see <<cases-api-update>>).
