[[case-api-update-connector]]
=== Update case configurations

Updates the connector's case closure settings.

Connectors are used to interface with external systems. You can only call this
method after you have created a connector (see <<register-connector>>). After a
connector has been created and assigned, call <<cases-actions-api-execute>> to
send cases to the external system.
