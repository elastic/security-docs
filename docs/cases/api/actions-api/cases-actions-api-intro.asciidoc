== Actions API (for pushing cases to external systems)

You can push {es-sec} cases to these third-party systems:

* {sn}
* {jira} (including Jira Service Desk)
* {ibm-r}
* {swimlane}


To push cases, you need to create a connector, which stores the information
required to communicate with the external system.

{es-sec} uses these external APIs to send cases:

* {sn}: https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/rome/rest/c_ImportSetAPI[Import Set API]
+
IMPORTANT: {sn} ITSM and SecOps connectors created in {stack} version 7.15.0 or earlier use the https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/quebec/rest/c_TableAPI[Table API]. They are marked as deprecated after you upgrade to version 7.16.0 or later and must be <<post-upgrade-deprecated-sn-connector, updated>> to ensure you have access to new connector enhancements. For example, you can push incident updates from cases using connectors created in version 7.15.0 or earlier. However, pushing incident updates from rules is a newer enhancement and you must update your connector or create a new one to use it.

* {jira}: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/[REST API v2]
* {ibm-r}: https://developer.ibm.com/security/resilient/rest/[Resilient REST API]
* {swimlane}: https://swimlane.com/knowledge-center/docs/developer-guide/rest-api/[Swimlane REST API]

To send cases to an external system and keep the {es-sec-ui} updated:

. {kibana-ref}/create-connector-api.html[Create connector]: Create the connector.
. {kibana-ref}/cases-api-create.html[Create case]: Create a case with the connector from the previous step.
. {kibana-ref}/cases-api-push.html[Push case]: Push the case to the external system.
