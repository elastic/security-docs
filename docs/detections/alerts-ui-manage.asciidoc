[[detection-view-and-filter-alerts]]
=== View and filter detection alerts
The Alerts page offers various ways for you to organize and triage detection alerts as you investigate suspicious events. You can:

* View an alert's details. Click the *View details* button from the Alerts table to open the alert details flyout. Learn more at <<view-alert-details>>.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/view-alert-details.png[View details button, 200]

* View the rule that created an alert. Click a name in the *Rule* column to open the rule's details page.

* View the details of the host and user associated with the alert. In the Alerts table, click a host name to open the <<host-details-flyout, host details flyout>>, or a user name to open the <<user-details-flyout, user details flyout>>.

* Filter for a specific rule in the KQL bar (for example, `kibana.alert.rule.name :"SSH (Secure Shell) from the Internet"`). KQL autocomplete is available for `.alerts-security.alerts-*` indices.

* Use the date and time filter to define a specific time range. By default, this filter is set to search the last 24 hours.

* Use the drop-down filter controls to filter alerts by up to four fields. By default, you can filter alerts by *Status*, *Severity*, *User*, and *Host*, and you can <<drop-down-filter-controls,edit the controls>> to use other fields.

* Visualize and group alerts by specific fields in the visualization section. Use the buttons on the left to select a view type (*Summary*, *Trend*, *Counts*, or *Treemap*), and use the menus on the right to select the ECS fields used for grouping alerts. Refer to <<visualize-alerts>> for more on each view type.

* Hover over a value to display available <<inline-actions, inline actions>>, such as *Filter In*, *Filter Out*, and *Add to timeline*. Click the expand icon for more options, including *Show top _x_* and *Copy to Clipboard*. The available options vary based on the type of data.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/inline-actions-menu.png[Inline additional actions menu,55%]

* Filter alert results to include building block alerts or to only show alerts from indicator match rules by selecting the *Additional filters* drop-down. By default, <<building-block-rule, building block alerts>> are excluded from the Overview and Alerts pages. You can choose to include building block alerts on the Alerts page, which expands the number of alerts.
+
NOTE: When updating alert results to include building block alerts, the Security app searches the `.alerts-security.alerts-<Kibana space>` index for the `kibana.alert.building_block_type` field. When looking for alerts created from indicator match rules, the app searches the same index for `kibana.alert.rule.type:'threat_match'`.
+

* beta:[] To bulk-change the status of <<group-alerts,grouped alerts>>, select the *Take actions* menu for the group, then select a status.

* In an alert's details flyout, click *Take action* and select a status.

[float]
[[apply-alert-tags]]
==== Apply and filter alert tags

Use alert tags to organize related alerts into categories that you can filter and group. For example, use the `False Positive` alert tag to label a group of alerts as false positives. Then, search for them by entering the `kibana.alert.workflow_tags : "False Positive"` query into the KQL bar. Alternatively, use the Alert table's <<drop-down-filter-controls,drop-down filters>> to filter for tagged alerts. 

NOTE: You can manage alert tag options by updating the `securitySolution:alertTags` advanced setting. Refer to <<manage-alert-tags>> for more information. 

TIP: To display alert tags in the Alerts table, click **Fields** and add the `kibana.alert.workflow_tags` field. 

To apply or remove alert tags on individual alerts, do one of the following:

** In the Alerts table, click *More actions* (*...*) in an alert's row, then click *Apply alert tags*. Select or unselect tags, then click *Apply tags*. 
** In an alert’s details flyout, click *Take action -> Apply alert tags*. Select or unselect tags, then click *Apply tags*. 

To apply or remove alert tags on multiple alerts, select the alerts you want to change, then click *Selected _x_ alerts* at the upper-left above the table. Click *Apply alert tags*, select or unselect tags, then click *Apply tags*.

[[assign-users-to-alerts]]
==== Assign users to alerts

Assign users to alerts that you want them to investigate, and manage alert assignees throughout an alert's lifecycle.  

IMPORTANT: Users are not notified when they've been assigned to, or unassigned from, alerts.  

|==============================================
| Action | Instructions 

| Assign users to an alert 

a| Choose one of the following:

* **Alerts table** - Click **More actions** (**...**) in an alert's row, then click **Assign alert**. Select users, then click **Apply**. 
* **Alert details flyout** - Click **Take action -> Assign alert**. Alternatively, click the **Assign alert** icon at the top of the alert details flyout, select users, then click **Apply**. 

|Unassign all users from an alert

a| Choose one of the following:

* **Alerts table** - Click **More actions** (**...**) in an alert's row, then click **Unassign alert**.  
* **Alert details flyout** - Click **Take action -> Unassign alert**. 

| Assign users to multiple alerts

a| From the Alerts table, select the alerts you want to change. Click **Selected _x_ alerts** at the upper-left above the table, then click **Assign alert**. Select users, then click **Apply**. 

NOTE: Users assigned to some of the selected alerts will be displayed as unassigned in the selection list. Selecting said users will assign them to all alerts they haven't been assigned to yet.

| Unassign users from multiple alerts

| From the Alerts table, select the alerts you want to change and click **Selected _x_ alerts** at the upper-left above the table. Click **Unassign alert** to remove users from the alert. 

|==============================================

Show users that have been assigned to alerts by adding the **Assignees** column to the Alerts table (**Fields** → `kibana.alert.workflow_assignee_ids`). Up to four assigned users can appear in the **Assignees** column. If an alert is assigned to five or more users, a number appears instead. 

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/alert-assigned-alerts.png[Alert assignees in the Alerts table, 650]

Assigned users are automatically displayed in the alert details flyout. Up to two assigned users can be shown in the flyout. If an alert is assigned to three or more users, a numbered badge displays instead.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/alert-flyout-assignees.png[Alert assignees in the alert details flyout, 450]

[float]
[[filter-assigned-alerts]]
==== Filter assigned alerts

Click the **Assignees** filter above the Alerts table, then select the users you want to filter by. 

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/alert-filter-assigned-alerts.png[Filtering assigned alerts, 650]

[float]
[[add-exception-from-alerts]]
==== Add a rule exception from an alert

You can add exceptions to the rule that generated an alert directly from the
Alerts table. Exceptions prevent a rule from generating alerts even when its
criteria are met.

To add an exception, click the *More actions* menu (*...*) in the Alerts table, then select
*Add exception*. Alternatively, select *Take action* -> *Add rule exception* in the alert details flyout.

For information about exceptions and how to use them, refer to
<<add-exceptions>>.

[float]
[[signals-to-timelines]]
==== View alerts in Timeline

* To view a single alert in Timeline, click the *Investigate in timeline* button in the Alerts table. Alternatively, select *Take action* -> *Investigate in timeline* in the alert details flyout.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/timeline-button.png[Investigate in timeline button, 300]

* To view multiple alerts in Timeline (up to 2,000), select the checkboxes next to the alerts, then click *Selected _x_ alerts* -> *Investigate in timeline*.
+
image::images/bulk-add-alerts-to-timeline.png[Bulk add alerts to timeline button,50%,50%]

TIP: When you send an alert generated by a
<<rules-ui-create, threshold rule>> to Timeline, all matching events are
listed in the Timeline, even ones that did not reach the threshold value. For
example, if you have an alert generated by a threshold rule that detects 10
failed login attempts, when you send that alert to Timeline, all failed login
attempts detected by the rule are listed.

Suppose the rule that generated the alert uses a Timeline template. In this case, when you investigate the alert in Timeline, the dropzone query values defined in the template are replaced with their corresponding alert values.

// * `host.name`
// * `host.hostname`
// * `host.domain`
// * `host.id`
// * `host.ip`
// * `client.ip`
// * `destination.ip`
// * `server.ip`
// * `source.ip`
// * `network.community_id`
// * `user.name`
// * `process.name`

*Example*

This Timeline template uses the `host.name: "{host.name}"` dropzone filter in
the rule. When alerts generated by the rule are investigated in Timeline, the
`{host.name}` value is replaced with the alert's `host.name` value. If the
alerts's `host.name` value is `Windows-ArsenalFC`, the Timeline dropzone query
is `host.name: "Windows-ArsenalFC"`.

NOTE: Refer to <<timelines-ui>> for information on creating Timelines and Timeline
templates. For information on how to add Timeline templates to rules, refer to <<rules-ui-create>>.
