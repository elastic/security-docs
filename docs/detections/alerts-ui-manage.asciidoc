== Manage detection alerts

The Detections page displays all <<detection-alert-def, detection alerts>>.
From the Alerts table, you can filter alerts, change an alert's status, and start
investigating and analyzing alerts in Timeline.

TIP: From Timeline, you can <<cases-ui-open, create cases>> to track issues and
share information with colleagues.

[[detection-view-and-filter-alerts]]
=== View and filter detection alerts
The Detections page offers various ways for you to organize and triage detection alerts as you investigate suspicious events. You can:

* Filter for a specific rule in the KQL bar (for example,
`signal.rule.name :"SSH (Secure Shell) from the Internet"`).

NOTE: KQL autocomplete for `.siem-signals-*` indices is available on the
*Detections* and *Rule details* pages, and in Timeline when either `All` or
`Detection alerts` is selected.

* Use the date and time filter to select a time range that you’re interested in exploring. By default, this filter is set to search the last 24 hours.
* View detection alerts generated by a specific rule. To do this, click *Manage detection rules*, then click on a rule name in the All rules table. The *Rules detail page* displays a comprehensive view of the rule's details, and alert details are displayed in the Alerts table beneath the Trend histogram.
* Use the *Stack by* dropdown in the Trend histogram to select specific parameters by which to visualize the individual counts. For example, if you select `signal.rule.name`, the histogram displays the total counts by alert name.
* Filter alert results to include building block alerts or to only show alerts from indicator match rules by selecting the *Additional filters* drop-down. By default, building block alerts are excluded from the Alerts table; therefore, including them expands the number of alerts.

NOTE: When updating alert results to also include building block alerts, the Security app searches the `.siem-signals-<Kibana space>` index for the `signal.rule.building_block_type` field. When looking for alerts created from indicator match rules, the app searches the same index for the `signal.rule.threat_mapping` field.

[[customize-the-alerts-table]]
=== Customize the Alerts table
Use the buttons in the upper left corner of the Alerts table to customize the columns you want displayed and to view the table in full-screen mode.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/alert-table-columns-and-size.gif[width=100%][height=100%][Demo that shows how to select the customize display button and full screen button]

Click the *Customize Event Renderers* button to enable event renderers within the Alerts table. When enabled, event renderers show relevant details that provide more context to the event. For example, if you enable the *Flow* Event Renderer, the Alerts table shows relevant details describing the data flow between a source and destination. These details include information such as hosts, ports, protocol, direction, duration, amount transferred, process, and geographic location.

[role="screenshot"]

All event renderers are disabled by default. To switch between event views in the Alerts table, you can enable individual event renderers or click *Enable all*. Closing the *Customize Event Renderers* page saves your configurations.

[[view-alert-details]]
=== View alert details
To further inspect an alert, click the *View details* button from the Alerts table.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/view-alert-details.png[Shows the Event Renderer button, 200]

The Alert details flyout appears and offers several options for viewing alert details:

* *Summary*: Shows an aggregated view of alert details. Alerts that have been enriched with `threat.indicator` data also display the *threat summary* section, which is an additional section located beneath the alert summary. In the *threat summary* section, you can view mapped data for the following `threat.indicator` subfields:
** `matched.field`
** `matched.type`
** `source (threat.indicator.provider)`
** `first_seen`
** `last_seen`

NOTE: If an alert is linked to more than one threat, `threat.indicator` data is still aggregated under the *threat summary* section, but will be parsed out in the *Threat Intel* tab.

* *Threat Intel*: Shows the number of matched threats and displays them individually. Threats appear in reverse chronological order, with the most recent alerts at the top. The available `threat.indicator` and `source.event` data is displayed for each threat. If the alert has not been enriched with threat data, the *Threat Intel* tab displays the message "No Threat Intel Enrichment Found" and provides a link to Threat Intel module documentation.
* *Table*: Shows the alert details in table format. Alert details are organized into field value pairs.
* *JSON View*: Shows the alert details in JSON format.

[[detection-alert-status]]
=== Change alert statuses

You can set an alert's status to indicate whether it needs to be investigated
(*Open*), is under active investigation (*In progress*), or resolved
(*Closed*). By default, the Alerts table displays open alerts. To view alerts
with other statuses, click *In progress* or *Closed*.

To change alert statuses, either:

* In the alert's row, click the *More actions* button, then select the appropriate status (*Mark in progress*, *Close alert*, or *Open alert*).
* In the Alerts table, select all the alerts you want to change, and then select
*Take action* -> *Close selected*, *Open selected*, or *Mark in progress*.

[float]
[[signals-to-cases]]
=== Add alerts to cases
From the Alerts table, you can attach one or more alerts to a case by using the *Add to case* button. From here, you can choose to <<signals-to-new-cases, add the alert to a new case>> or <<signals-to-existing-cases, attach it to an existing one>>. There is no limit to the number of alerts that you can add and you can choose alerts from any rule type - custom or pre-built. If the case has been configured to sync its status with associated alerts, the alert's status will update after it's been added. If this setting isn't enabled, the alert's status will not change after you've added it.

NOTE: After you have added an alert to a case, you can only remove it through the the Elastic Security Cases API.

[[signals-to-new-cases]]
==== Add an alert to a new case
Follow these steps to add an alert to a new case:

. Select **Add to case -> Add to a new case**.
. In the flyout, give your case a name, add relevant tags, and include a case description.
. Specify whether you want to sync the statuses of associated alerts. This setting is enabled by default to enforce asynchronous communication between alerts and cases and can be toggled on or off at any time.
. Select a connector. If you've previously added one, that connector displays as the default selection. Otherwise, the default setting is `No connector selected`.
. Click *Create case* after you've completed all of the required fields. A notification message confirming the case was successfully created displays. Click the link inside the notification or go to the Cases page to view your case.

[[signals-to-timelines]]
=== Send alerts to Timeline

To view an alert in Timeline, click the *Investigate in timeline* button.

TIP: When you send an alert generated by a
<<rules-ui-create, threshold rule>> to Timeline, all matching events are
listed in the Timeline, even ones that did not reach the threshold value. For
example, if you have an alert generated by a threshold rule that detects 10
failed login attempts, when you send that alert to Timeline all failed login
attempts detected by the rule are listed.

Suppose the rule that generated the alert uses a Timeline template. In this case, when you investigate the alert in Timeline, the dropzone query values defined in the template are replaced with their corresponding alert values.

// * `host.name`
// * `host.hostname`
// * `host.domain`
// * `host.id`
// * `host.ip`
// * `client.ip`
// * `destination.ip`
// * `server.ip`
// * `source.ip`
// * `network.community_id`
// * `user.name`
// * `process.name`

*Example*

This Timeline template uses the `host.name: "{host.name}"` dropzone filter in
the rule. When alerts generated by the rule are investigated in Timeline, the
`{host.name}` value is replaced with the alert's `host.name` value. If the
alerts's `host.name` value is `Windows-ArsenalFC`, the Timeline dropzone query
is `host.name: "Windows-ArsenalFC"`.

NOTE: See <<timelines-ui>> for information on creating Timelines and Timeline
templates. For information on how to add Timeline templates to rules, see
<<rules-ui-create>>.

[float]
[[add-exception-from-alerts]]
=== Add rule exceptions

You can add exceptions to the rule that generated the alert directly from the
Alerts table. Exceptions prevent a rule from generating alerts even when its
criteria are met.

To add an exception, click the actions button (three dots) and then select
_Add exception_.

For information about exceptions and how to use them, see
<<detections-ui-exceptions>>.

[float]
[[alerts-analyze-events]]
=== Visually analyze process relationships

For process events received from the Elastic Endpoint agent, you can open a
visual mapping of the relationships and hierarchy connecting related processes. For more information see, <<visual-event-analyzer>>.
