[[detection-view-and-filter-alerts]]
=== View and filter detection alerts
The Alerts page offers various ways for you to organize and triage detection alerts as you investigate suspicious events. You can:

* View an alert's details. Click the *View details* button from the Alerts table to open the alert details flyout. Learn more at <<view-alert-details>>.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/view-alert-details.png[View details button, 200]

* Filter for a specific rule in the KQL bar (for example, `kibana.alert.rule.name :"SSH (Secure Shell) from the Internet"`). KQL autocomplete is available for `.alerts-security.alerts-*` indices.

* Use the date and time filter to define a specific time range. By default, this filter is set to search the last 24 hours.

* Use the drop-down filter controls to filter alerts by up to four fields. By default, you can filter alerts by *Status*, *Severity*, *User*, and *Host*, and you can <<drop-down-filter-controls,edit the controls>> to use other fields.

* Visualize and group alerts by specific fields in the visualization section. Use the buttons on the left to select a view type (*Summary*, *Trend*, *Counts*, or *Treemap*), and use the menus on the right to select the ECS fields used for grouping alerts. Refer to <<visualize-alerts>> for more on each view type.

* Hover over a value in the data grid to display available inline actions, such as *Filter In*, *Filter Out*, and *Add to timeline investigation*. Click the expand button to open a full context menu of options, including *Show top values*, *Copy to Clipboard*, and *View rule details*. The available options vary based on the type of data.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/inline-actions-menu.gif[width=75%][height=75%][Animation of using the inline additional actions menu]

* Filter alert results to include building block alerts or to only show alerts from indicator match rules by selecting the *Additional filters* drop-down. By default, <<building-block-rule, building block alerts>> are excluded from the Overview and Alerts pages. You can choose to include building block alerts on the Alerts page, which expands the number of alerts.
+
NOTE: When updating alert results to include building block alerts, the Security app searches the `.alerts-security.alerts-<Kibana space>` index for the `kibana.alert.building_block_type` field. When looking for alerts created from indicator match rules, the app searches the same index for `kibana.alert.rule.type:'threat_match'`.
+
[role="screenshot"]

* View detection alerts generated by a specific rule. Go to *Manage* -> *Rules*, then select a rule name in the table. The rule details page displays a comprehensive view of the rule's settings, and the Alerts table under the Trend histogram displays the alerts associated with the rule, including alerts from any previous or deleted revision of that rule.

[[drop-down-filter-controls]]
=== Edit drop-down filter controls

By default, the drop-down controls on the Alerts page filter alerts by *Status*, *Severity*, *User*, and *Host*. You can edit them to filter by different fields, as well as remove, add, and reorder them.

[NOTE]
====
* You can have a maximum of four controls on the Alerts page.
* You can't remove the *Status* control.
* If you make any changes to the controls, you _must_ save the pending changes in order for them to persist.
====

. Click the three-dot icon next to the controls (image:images/three-dot-icon-blue.png[Three-dot icon,18,18]), then select *Edit Controls*.

. Do any of the following:

* To reorder controls, click and drag a control by its handle (image:images/handle-icon.png[Control handle,18,18]).

* To remove a control, hover over it and select *Remove control* (image:images/red-x-icon.png[Red X icon,18,18]).

* To edit a control, hover over it and select *Edit control* (image:images/pencil-icon.png[Edit icon,18,18]).

* To add a new control, click *Add Controls* (image:images/add-icon-blue.png[Add icon,18,18]). If you already have four controls, you must first remove one to make room for the new one.

. If you're editing or adding a control, do the following in the configuration flyout that opens:

.. In the *Field* list, select the field for the filter. The *Control type* is automatically applied for the field you selected.

.. Enter a *Label* to identify the control.

.. Click *Save and close*.

. Click *Save pending changes* (image:images/save-icon-blue.png[Save icon,18,18]).

[[customize-the-alerts-table]]
=== Customize the Alerts table
Use the toolbar buttons in the upper-left of the Alerts table to customize the columns you want displayed:

* **Columns**: Reorder the columns.
* **_x_ fields sorted**: Sort the table by one or more columns.
* **Fields**: Select the fields to display in the table. You can also add <<runtime-fields, runtime fields>> to detection alerts and display them in the Alerts table.

Click the *Full screen* button in the upper-right to view the table in full-screen mode.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/alert-table-toolbar-buttons.png[Alerts table with toolbar buttons highlighted]

Use the view options drop-down in the upper-right of the Alerts table to control how alerts are displayed:

* *Grid view*: Displays alerts in a traditional table view with columns for each field
* *Event rendered view*: Display alerts in a descriptive event flow that includes relevant details and context about the event.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/event-rendered-view.png[Alerts table with the Event rendered view enabled]

TIP: When using grid view, you can view alert-rendered reason statements and event renderings for specific alerts by clicking the expand icon in the *Reason* column. Some events do not have event renderings.

[float]
[[alert-actions]]
=== Take actions on an alert
From the Alerts table or the alert details flyout, you can:

* <<signals-to-cases>>
* <<detection-alert-status>>
* <<add-exception-from-alerts>>
* <<endpoint-rule-exceptions,Add an endpoint exception from an alert>>
* <<host-isolation-ov,Isolate an alert's host>>
* <<response-actions,Perform response actions on an alert's host>> (Alert details flyout only)
* <<alerts-run-osquery, Run Osquery against an alert>>
* <<signals-to-timelines>>
* <<visual-event-analyzer,Visually analyze an alert's process relationships>>

[float]
[[detection-alert-status]]
==== Change an alert's status

You can set an alert's status to indicate whether it needs to be investigated
(*Open*), is under active investigation (*Acknowledged*), or has been resolved
(*Closed*). By default, the Alerts page displays open alerts. To filter alerts that are *Acknowledged* or *Closed*, use the *Status* drop-down filter at the top of the Alerts page. This filters all of the results displayed on the page.

To change an alert's status, do one of the following:

* In the Alerts table, click *More actions* (*...*) in the alert's row, then select a status.

* In the Alerts table, select the alerts you want to change, click *Selected _x_ alerts* at the upper-left above the table, and then select a status.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/alert-change-status.png[Bulk action menu with multiple alerts selected, 225]

* beta:[] To bulk-change the status of <<group-alerts,grouped alerts>>, select the *Take actions* menu for the group, then select a status.

* In an alert's details flyout, click *Take action* and select a status.

[float]
[[add-exception-from-alerts]]
==== Add a rule exception from an alert

You can add exceptions to the rule that generated an alert directly from the
Alerts table. Exceptions prevent a rule from generating alerts even when its
criteria are met.

To add an exception, click the *More actions* menu (*...*) in the Alerts table, then select
*Add exception*. Alternatively, select *Take action* -> *Add rule exception* in the alert details flyout.

For information about exceptions and how to use them, refer to
<<add-exceptions>>.

[float]
[[signals-to-timelines]]
==== View alerts in Timeline

* To view a single alert in Timeline, click the *Investigate in timeline* button in the Alerts table. Alternatively, select *Take action* -> *Investigate in timeline* in the alert details flyout.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/timeline-button.png[Investigate in timeline button, 300]

* To view multiple alerts in Timeline (up to 2,000), select the checkboxes next to the alerts, then click *Selected _x_ alerts* -> *Investigate in timeline*.
+
image::images/bulk-add-alerts-to-timeline.png[Bulk add alerts to timeline button,30%,30%]


TIP: When you send an alert generated by a
<<rules-ui-create, threshold rule>> to Timeline, all matching events are
listed in the Timeline, even ones that did not reach the threshold value. For
example, if you have an alert generated by a threshold rule that detects 10
failed login attempts, when you send that alert to Timeline, all failed login
attempts detected by the rule are listed.

Suppose the rule that generated the alert uses a Timeline template. In this case, when you investigate the alert in Timeline, the dropzone query values defined in the template are replaced with their corresponding alert values.

// * `host.name`
// * `host.hostname`
// * `host.domain`
// * `host.id`
// * `host.ip`
// * `client.ip`
// * `destination.ip`
// * `server.ip`
// * `source.ip`
// * `network.community_id`
// * `user.name`
// * `process.name`

*Example*

This Timeline template uses the `host.name: "{host.name}"` dropzone filter in
the rule. When alerts generated by the rule are investigated in Timeline, the
`{host.name}` value is replaced with the alert's `host.name` value. If the
alerts's `host.name` value is `Windows-ArsenalFC`, the Timeline dropzone query
is `host.name: "Windows-ArsenalFC"`.

NOTE: Refer to <<timelines-ui>> for information on creating Timelines and Timeline
templates. For information on how to add Timeline templates to rules, refer to <<rules-ui-create>>.
