== Add runtime fields to detection alerts

Runtime fields are fields that you can add to documents after you've ingested your data. For example, you could combine two fields and treat them as one, or perform calculations on existing data and use the result as a separate field. Runtime fields are evaluated when a query is run. 

You can add a runtime field to your detection alerts from the *Alerts* table. The new field applies to all {elastic-sec} alerts.

NOTE: Runtime fields can impact performance, because they're evaluated each time a query runs. Refer to {ref}/runtime.html[Runtime fields] for more information.

To add a runtime field to detection alerts:

. Go to *Detect* -> *Alerts*, then click the *Fields* toolbar button at the upper-left of the *Alerts* table. The *Fields* browser opens.

. Enter a *Name* for the new field.

. Select a *Type* for the field's data type.

. Turn on the *Set value* toggle and enter a {ref}/modules-scripting-painless.html[Painless script] to define the field's value. The script must match the selected *Type*. For more on adding fields and Painless scripting examples, refer to {kibana-ref}/managing-data-views.html#runtime-fields[Explore your data with runtime fields].

. Use the *Preview* to help you build the script so that it returns the expected field value.

. Configure other field settings as needed. 
+
NOTE: Some runtime field settings, such as custom labels and display formats, display in other areas of {kib} but may not display in the {security-app}. 

. Click *Save*.
