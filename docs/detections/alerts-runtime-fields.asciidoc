== Add runtime fields to detection alerts

Runtime fields are fields that you can add to documents after you've ingested your data, and they are evaluated at query time. You can add runtime fields to detection alerts and display them in the Alerts table.

Runtime fields have several use cases, but they can also impact performance because they're evaluated each time a query runs. Refer to {ref}/runtime.html[Runtime fields] for more information.

To add a runtime field to detection alerts:

. Go to *Detect* -> *Alerts*, then click the *Fields* toolbar button at the upper-left of the *Alerts* table. The *Fields* browser opens.

. Enter a *Name* for the new field.

. Select a *Type* for the field's {ref}/mapping-types.html[data type].

. Turn on the *Set value* toggle and enter a {ref}/modules-scripting-painless.html[Painless script] to define the field's value. The script must match the selected *Type*.

. Use the *Preview* to help you build the script so that it returns the expected field value.

. Configure other field settings as needed. Refer to {kibana-ref}/managing-data-views.html#runtime-fields[Explore your data with runtime fields] for more information.

NOTE: Some runtime field settings, such as custom labels and display formats, may not display in the {security-app}. 

. Click *Save*.
