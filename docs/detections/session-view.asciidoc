== Session view

beta::[]

Session View is an investigation tool that allows you to view and analyze Linux process data organized
in a tree according to the Linux logical event model, with processes organized by parentage and time of execution.
It displays events in a highly readable format inspired by the terminal, making it a powerful tool for monitoring
and investigating session activity on your Linux infrastructure and understanding user and service behavior.

====== Session View displays:
* *Interactive and non-interactive processes:* Processes and services with or without a controlling tty.
* *User information:* The Linux user that executed each session or process, and any exec user changes.
* *Process and event telemetry:* Process information included in the Linux logical event model.
* *Nested sessions:* Sessions started by processes descended from the entry session.
* *Alerts:* Alerts in the context of the processes which caused them.

=== Enable session view data
Session View uses process data collected by the {endpoint-sec} integration,
but this data is not collected by default. To enable Session View data, navigate to the Endpoint Security
integration and edit one or more of your integration policies. Search the policy's settings for “session data”,
and enable “Include session data” near the bottom of the page. Only data collected by {endpoint-sec} with this setting
enabled can be viewed in Session View.  For more information about the additional
fields collected by the {endpoint-sec} when this setting is enabled, see https://www.elastic.co/[placeholder link].

[[session-view-ui]]
=== Session View UI
When you click Open Session View, the following display appears. Labeled features are described below:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/session-view-terminal-labeled.png[]

1. The *Close Session* and *Full screen* buttons.
2. The search bar, where you can find and highlight search terms within the current session.
The buttons on the right side of the search bar allow you to jump through search results.
3. The *display settings* button. Click here to toggle timestamps and verbose mode.
With verbose mode enabled, Session View shows all processes created in a session, including shell startup,
shell completion, and forks caused by built-in commands.
It defaults to *off* in order to highlight the data most likely to be user-generated and non-standard.
4. The *details panel* button. Click it to toggle the details panel, which appears below the button
and displays a wide range of additional information about the selected process’s ancestry and host,
and any associated alerts. In the example above, the startup process is selected.
To select a process in Session View, click on it.
5. The startup process. In this example it shows that the session was a bash session.
It also shows the Linux user that started the session.
6. The *Child processes* button. Click to expand or collapse a process’s children.
You can also expand collapsed alerts and scripts where they appear.
Collapsed processes will automatically expand when their contents match a search.
