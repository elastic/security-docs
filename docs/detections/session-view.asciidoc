== Session View

Session View is an investigation tool that allows you to examine Linux process data organized
in a tree-like structure according to the Linux logical event model, with processes organized by parentage and time of execution.
It displays events in a highly readable format that is inspired by the terminal. This makes it a powerful tool for monitoring
and investigating session activity on your Linux infrastructure and understanding user and service behavior.

NOTE: Session View requires an Enterprise subscription.

[[session-view-data]]
====== Session View displays:
* *Interactive and non-interactive processes:* Processes and services with or without a controlling tty.
* *User information:* The Linux user that executed each session or process, and any exec user changes.
* *Process and event telemetry:* Process information included in the Linux logical event model.
* *Nested sessions:* Sessions started by processes descended from the entry session.
* *Alerts:* Alerts in the context of the processes which caused them.
* *TTY output:* Terminal output associated with each process in the session.

NOTE: To view Linux session data from your Kubernetes infrastructure, you'll need to set up the <<kubernetes-dashboard,Kubernetes dashboard>>.

[[enable-session-view]]
=== Enable Session View data
Session View uses process data collected by the {elastic-defend} integration,
but this data is not collected by default. To enable Session View data: go to *Manage* -> *Policies*
and edit one or more of your {elastic-defend} integration policies. On the *Policy settings* tab,
scroll down to the Linux event collection section near the bottom of the page
and turn on the *Include session data* toggle. To enable TTY output capture, turn on the *Capture terminal output* toggle.
Session View can only display data that was collected by {elastic-defend} when this setting was enabled. For more information about the additional
fields collected by {elastic-defend} when this setting is enabled, refer to the https://github.com/elastic/ecs/blob/main/rfcs/text/0030-linux-event-model.md[Linux event model RFC].

[[open-session-view]]
=== Open Session View
Session View is accessible from the **Hosts**, **Alerts**, and **Timelines** pages, as well as the **Kubernetes** dashboard.
Events and sessions that you can investigate in Session View have a rectangular
*Open Session View* button in the *Actions* column. For example:

* On the Alerts page, scroll down to view the Alerts table.
Look for alerts that have the **Open Session View** button in the **Actions** column:

* On the Hosts page (*Explore* -> *Hosts*), select the *Sessions* or the *Events* tab.
From either of these tabs, click the *Open Session View* icon for an event or session.
Labeled below are *1.* the *Sessions* tab, and *2.* the *Open Session View* icon:

[[session-view-ui]]
=== Session View UI
The Session View UI has the following features:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/session-view-terminal-labeled.png[Detail of Session view with labeled UI elements,width=150%]

1. The *Close Session* and *Full screen* buttons.
2. The search bar. Use it to find and highlight search terms within the current session.
The buttons on its right side allow you to jump through search results.
3. The *display settings* button. Click to toggle Timestamps and Verbose mode.
With Verbose mode enabled, Session View shows all processes created in a session, including shell startup,
shell completion, and forks caused by built-in commands.
It defaults to *off* to highlight the data most likely to be user-generated and non-standard.
4. The *Detail panel* button. Click it to toggle the Detail panel, which appears below the button
and displays a wide range of additional information about the selected process’s ancestry and host,
and any associated alerts. To select a process in Session View, click on it.
5. The startup process. In this example, it shows that the session was a bash session.
It also shows the Linux user "Ubuntu" started the session.
6. The *Child processes* button. Click to expand or collapse a process’s children.
You can also expand collapsed alerts and scripts where they appear.
Collapsed processes will automatically expand when their contents match a search.
7. The *Alerts* button. Click to show alerts caused by the parent process. Note the red line to the left
of the process that caused the alert.
8. The *TTY output* button. Hover to see how much output data has been captured from the session. Click to open  Terminal output view, which is described in detail below.
9. The *Refresh session* button. Click to check for any new data from the current session.

Session View includes two additional badges not pictured above:
//
//* The *Script* button allows you to expand or collapse executed scripts:

* The *Exec user change* badge highlights exec user changes, such as when a user escalates to root:

=== Terminal output view UI

beta::[]

Terminal output view helps provide a more complete understanding of commands executed by users or adversaries, and assists with auditing and compliance objectives. It allows you to review a session's TTY output, in the context of the commands which generated it. It includes both TTY output, and commands entered into a shell as typed — provided the shell was in echo mode (for background information about Linux terminals, refer to https://github.com/elastic/security-team/blob/main/docs/adaptive-workload-protection-team/architecture/linux-terminals.md[Linux terminals]).

To enable Terminal output data capture: go to *Manage* -> *Policies*
and edit one or more of your {elastic-defend} integration policies. On the *Policy settings* tab,
scroll down to the Linux event collection section near the bottom of the page
and turn on *Include session data* and *Capture terminal output*. You can configure several additional settings by clicking *Advanced settings* at the bottom of the page:
* Select the maximum number of kilobytes of output to record from a single process by modifying `linux.advanced.tty_io.max_kilobytes_per_process`. Defaults to 512 KB. For example, with the default value, a process' output will not be recorded after the 512th KB.
* Select the maximum number of kilobytes of output to send to {es} as a single event by modifying `linux.advanced.tty_io.max_kilobytes_per_event`. Defaults to 512 KB. For example, with the default value, the maximum amount of output that will be sent to {es} as a single event is 512 KB. Additional data will be captured as a new event.
* Select the maximum duration in seconds for which output is batched by modifying `linux.advanced.tty_io.max_event_interval_seconds`. Defaults to 30 seconds. For example, with the default value, any recorded output will be sent to {es} every 30 seconds (unless it first exceeds the `max_kilobytes_per_event` value, in which case it might be sent sooner).

1. The search bar. Use to find and highlight search terms within the current session.
The buttons on its right side allow you to jump through search results.
2. The right-side scroll bar. Use along with the bottom-side scroll bar to navigate output data that doesn't fit on a single screen.
3. The playback controls: *Start*, *Prev*, *Play*, *Next*, *Last*, and the progress bar. Use to advance or rewind the session's commands and output. Click anywhere on the progress bar to jump to that part of the session. The marks on the timeline represent processes that generated output, click them or click the *Prev* and *Next* buttons to skip between processes.
4. The *Fit screen*, *Zoom in*, and *Zoom out* buttons. Use to adjust the text size. Use Session view's *Fullscreen* button (located next to the *Close session viewer* button) to improve the display of output that doesn't easily fit, especially for graphical programs like `vim`.
