== Session View

beta::[]

Session View is an investigation tool that allows you to examine Linux process data organized
in a tree-like structure according to the Linux logical event model, with processes organized by parentage and time of execution.
It displays events in a highly readable format that is inspired by the terminal. This makes it a powerful tool for monitoring
and investigating session activity on your Linux infrastructure and understanding user and service behavior.

[[session-view-data]]
====== Session View displays:
* *Interactive and non-interactive processes:* Processes and services with or without a controlling tty.
* *User information:* The Linux user that executed each session or process, and any exec user changes.
* *Process and event telemetry:* Process information included in the Linux logical event model.
* *Nested sessions:* Sessions started by processes descended from the entry session.
* *Alerts:* Alerts in the context of the processes which caused them.

NOTE: To view Linux session data from your Kubernetes infrastructure, you'll need to set up the <<kubernetes-dashboard,Kubernetes dashboard>>.

[[enable-session-view]]
=== Enable Session View data
Session View uses process data collected by the {elastic-defend} integration,
but this data is not collected by default. To enable Session View data, go to *Manage* -> *Policies*
and edit one or more of your {elastic-defend} integration policies. On the *Policy settings* tab,
scroll down to the Linux event collection section near the bottom of the page
and turn on the *Include session data* toggle. Session View can only display data that was
collected by {elastic-defend} when this setting was enabled. For more information about the additional
fields collected by {elastic-defend} when this setting is enabled, refer to the https://github.com/elastic/ecs/blob/main/rfcs/text/0030-linux-event-model.md[Linux event model RFC].

[[open-session-view]]
=== Open Session View
Session View is accessible from the **Hosts**, **Alerts**, and **Timelines** pages, as well as the **Kubernetes** dashboard.
Events and sessions that you can investigate in Session View have a rectangular
*Open Session View* button in the *Actions* column. For example:

* On the Alerts page, scroll down to view the Alerts table.
Look for alerts that have the **Open Session View** button in the **Actions** column:

* On the Hosts page (*Explore* -> *Hosts*), select the *Sessions* or the *Events* tab.
From either of these tabs, click the *Open Session View* icon for an event or session.
Labeled below are 1) the *Sessions* tab, and 2) the *Open Session View* icon:

[[session-view-ui]]
=== Session View UI
The Session View UI has the following features:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/session-view-terminal-labeled.png[Detail of Session view with labeled UI elements,width=150%]

1. The *Close Session* and *Full screen* buttons.
2. The search bar. Use it to find and highlight search terms within the current session.
The buttons on the right side of the search bar allow you to jump through search results.
3. The *display settings* button. Click to toggle Timestamps and Verbose mode.
With Verbose mode enabled, Session View shows all processes created in a session, including shell startup,
shell completion, and forks caused by built-in commands.
It defaults to *off* to highlight the data most likely to be user-generated and non-standard.
4. The *Detail panel* button. Click it to toggle the Detail panel, which appears below the button
and displays a wide range of additional information about the selected process’s ancestry and host,
and any associated alerts. To select a process in Session View, click on it.
5. The startup process. In this example, it shows that the session was a bash session.
It also shows the Linux user "Ubuntu" started the session.
6. The *Child processes* button. Click to expand or collapse a process’s children.
You can also expand collapsed alerts and scripts where they appear.
Collapsed processes will automatically expand when their contents match a search.
7. The *Alerts* button. Click to show alerts caused by the parent process. Note the red line to the left
of the process that caused the alert.

Session View includes an additional badge not pictured above:
