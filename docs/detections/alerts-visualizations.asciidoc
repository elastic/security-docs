== Visualize detection alerts

Visualize and group detection alerts by specific parameters in the visualization section of the Alerts page. Use the menu on the left to select a view type (*Trend*, *Table*, or *Treemap*), and use the menus on the right to select the ECS fields to group by.

Use the *Group by* and (if available) *Group by top* menus to select or enter any aggregatable ECS field that is available on your alerts. For example, if you select `kibana.alert.rule.name` for the trend view, the graph displays alerts grouped by detection rule name.

To reset a view to its default settings, click the settings menu (image:images/three-dot-icon.png[Settings menu icon,18,18]) in the upper-right and select *Reset group by fields* (the settings menu icon only appears when hovering over the area).

=== Trend
The trend view is a bar graph showing the occurrence of alerts over time. This is the default visualization on the Alerts page, and by default it groups alerts by detection rule name (`kibana.alert.rule.name`).

NOTE: The *Group by top* menu is unavailable for the trend view.

=== Table
The table view is a table showing the count of alerts in each group. By default, the table groups alerts by detection rule name (`kibana.alert.rule.name`) and host name (`host.name`).

=== Treemap
The treemap view is a diagram showing the distribution of alerts as nested, proportionally-sized tiles. This view can help you quickly pinpoint the most prevalent and critical alerts.

Larger tiles represent more frequent alerts, and each tile's color is based on the alerts' risk score:

* *Green*: Low risk (`0` - `21`)
* *Yellow*: Medium risk (`22` - `47`)
* *Orange*: High risk (`48` - `73`)
* *Red*: Critical risk (`74` - `100`)

By default, the treemap groups alerts by detection rule name (`kibana.alert.rule.name`) and host name (`host.name`).

NOTE: Depending on the amount of alerts, some tiles and text might be very small. Hover over the treemap to display the information in a tooltip.

You can click on parts of the treemap to narrow down the alerts being displayed. Click on the label at the top of a group to display just the alerts in that group, or click on an individual tile to display the alerts related to that tile. This adds filters to the Alerts page under the KQL search bar, which you can then edit or remove to further customize the view.
