== Visualize detection alerts

Visualize and group detection alerts by specific parameters in the visualization section of the Alerts page.

// Use the *Group by* and (if available) *Group by top* menus to select or enter any aggregatable ECS field that is available on your alerts. For example, if you select `kibana.alert.rule.name` for the trend view, the graph displays alerts grouped by detection rule name.

// You can group the alerts in the visualization by one or two data fields, depending on the view type.

Use the menu on the left to select a view type (*Trend*, *Table*, or *Treemap*), and use the menus on the right to select the ECS fields to use for grouping: 

* *Group by*: The primary field for grouping alerts.
* *Group by top* (if available): The secondary field for further subdividing grouped alerts.

// Use the *Group by* menu to select the primary field for grouping, and (if available) use *Group by top* to select a secondary field to further subdivide grouped alerts. 

For example, you can group first by rule name (`Group by: kibana.alert.rule.name`), then by host name (`Group by top: host.name`) to visualize which detection rules generated alerts, and which hosts triggered each of those rules. For groupings with a lot of unique data values, the top 1,000 results are displayed.

NOTE: The *Group by top* option isn't available in all view types. You can also leave *Group by top* blank to group the view by only the primary field in *Group by*.

To reset a view to its default settings, click the settings menu (image:images/three-dot-icon.png[Settings menu icon,18,18]) in the upper-right and select *Reset group by fields* (the settings menu appears when hovering over the area).

=== Trend
The trend view is a bar graph showing the occurrence of alerts over time. This is the default visualization on the Alerts page, and by default it groups alerts by detection rule name (`kibana.alert.rule.name`).

NOTE: The *Group by top* menu is unavailable for the trend view.

=== Table
The table view shows the count of alerts in each group. By default, the table groups alerts first by detection rule name (`kibana.alert.rule.name`), then by host name (`host.name`).

=== Treemap
The treemap view is a diagram showing the distribution of alerts as nested, proportionally-sized tiles. This view can help you quickly pinpoint the most prevalent and critical alerts.

Larger tiles represent more frequent alerts, and each tile's color is based on the alerts' risk score:

* *Green*: Low risk (`0` - `21`)
* *Yellow*: Medium risk (`22` - `47`)
* *Orange*: High risk (`48` - `73`)
* *Red*: Critical risk (`74` - `100`)

By default, the treemap groups alerts first by detection rule name (`kibana.alert.rule.name`), then by host name (`host.name`).

NOTE: Depending on the amount of alerts, some tiles and text might be very small. Hover over the treemap to display the information in a tooltip.

You can click on the treemap to narrow down the alerts displayed in both the treemap and the alerts table below. Click on the label above a group to display the alerts in that group, or click on an individual tile to display the alerts related to that tile. This adds filters under the KQL search bar, which you can edit or remove to further customize the view on the Alerts page.
