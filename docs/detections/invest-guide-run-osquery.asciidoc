=== Run Osquery from investigation guides
Investigation guides on detection rules provide guidance for triaging, analyzing, and responding to potential security issues. When you build a custom rule, you can also set up an investigation guide that incorporates Osquery. This allows you to run live queries from a rule's investigation guide as you analyze alerts produced by the rule.
