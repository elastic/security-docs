= Detections and Alerts (beta)

beta[]

Use the Detections feature to create and manage rules, and view the alerts
these rules create. Rules periodically search indices (such as `endgame-*` and
`filebeat-*`) for suspicious source events, and create alerts when a rule's
conditions are met. When an alert is created, its status is `Open`. To help
track investigations, an alert's status can be set as `Open`, `In progress`, or
`Closed` (see <<detection-alert-status>>).

In addition to creating <<rules-ui-create, your own rules>>, enable
<<load-prebuilt-rules, Elastic prebuilt rules>> to immediately start detecting
suspicious activity. For detailed information on all the prebuilt rules, see the
<<prebuilt-rules>> section. Once the prebuilt rules are loaded and
running, <<tuning-detection-signals>> and <<detections-ui-exceptions>> explain
how to modify the rules to reduce false positives and get a better set of
actionable alerts. You can also use exceptions and value lists when creating or
modifying your own rules.

There are two special prebuilt rules you need to know about:

* <<endpoint-security, *Endpoint Security*>>:
Automatically creates an alert from all incoming Elastic Endpoint alerts. To
receive Elastic Endpoint alerts, you must install the Endpoint agent on your
hosts (see <<install-endpoint>>).
+
When this rule is enabled, the following Endpoint events are displayed as
detection alerts:
+
** Malware Prevention Alert
** Malware Detection Alert
+
NOTE: When you load the prebuilt rules, this is the only rule that is enabled
by default.

* <<external-alerts, *External Alerts*>>: Automatically creates an alert for
all incoming third-party system alerts (for example, Suricata alerts).

If you want to receive notifications via external systems, such as Slack or
email, when alerts are created, use the {kib}
{kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html[Alerting and Actions] framework.

NOTE: To use {kib} Alerting for detection alert notifications, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license].

After rules have started running, you can monitor their executions to verify
they are functioning correctly, as well as view, manage, and troubleshoot
alerts (see <<alerts-ui-manage>> and <<alerts-ui-monitor>>).

You can create and manage rules and alerts via the UI or the
<<rule-api-overview, Detections API>>.

[[det-engine-terminology]]
== Terminology

Actions::
Sends notifications via other systems when a detection alert is created, such
as email, Slack, PagerDuty, and Webhook.

[[detection-alert-def]]
Detection alerts::
{es-sec} produced alerts. Detection alerts are never received from external
systems. When a rule's conditions are met, {es-sec} writes a detection alert to
an Elasticsearch `.signals` index.
+
[NOTE]
==============
Detection alert indices are created for each {kib} space. The naming convention
is: `.siem-signals-<space name>`. For the default space, the alerts index is
named `.siem-signals-default`.
==============

Detection rules::
Background tasks that run periodically and produce alerts when suspicious
activity is detected.

Endpoint exceptions::
<<term-exceptions, Exceptions>> added to both rules and Endpoint agents on
hosts. Endpoint exceptions can only be added when:

* Endpoint agents are installed on the hosts.
* The Elastic Endpoint Security rule is activated.

[[term-exceptions]]
Exceptions::
Added to rules to prevent specific source event field values from generating
alerts.

External alerts::
Alerts {es-sec} receives from external systems, such as Suricata.

[[malware-prevention]]
== Malware prevention

Malware, short for malicious software, is any software program designed to damage or execute unauthorized actions on a
computer system. Examples of malware include viruses, worms, Trojan horses, adware, scareware, and spyware. Some
malware, such as viruses, can severely damage a computer's hard drive by deleting files or directory information. Other
malware, such as spyware, can obtain user data without their knowledge.

Malware may be stealthy and appear as legitimate executable code, scripts, active content, and other software. It is also
often embedded in non-malicious files, non-suspicious websites, and standard programs — sometimes making the root
source difficult to identify. If infected and not resolved promptly, malware can cause irreparable damage to a computer
network.

For information on how to enable malware protection on your host, see <<configure-malware,  Configure Malware detect or prevent>>.

=== Machine Learning Model

To determine if a file is malicious or benign, a machine learning model looks for static attributes of files (without executing
the file) that include file structure, layout, and content. This includes information such as file header data, imports, exports,
section names, and file size. These attributes are extracted from millions of benign and malicious file samples, which then
are passed to a machine-learning algorithm that distinguishes a benign file from a malicious one. The machine learning
model is updated as new data is procured and analyzed.

[discrete]
=== Threshold

A malware threshold determines the action the agent should take if malware is detected. The Elastic Agent uses a recommended threshold level that generates a balanced number of alerts with a low probability of undetected malware. This threshold also minimizes the number of false positive alerts.

=== Resolve UI error messages

Depending on your privileges and whether detection system indices have already
been created for the {kib} space, you might see an error message  when you try
to open the *Detections* page.

*`Let’s set up your detection engine`*

If you see this message, a user with specific privileges must visit the
*Detections* page before you can view detection rules and alerts.
See <<enable-detections-ui>> for a list of all the requirements.

NOTE: For *self-managed* {stack} deployments only, this message may be displayed
when the
<<detections-permissions, `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey`>>
setting has not been added to the `kibana.yml` file. For more information, see <<detections-on-prem-requirements>>.

*`Detection engine permissions required`*

If you see this message, you do not have the
<<detections-permissions, required privileges>> to view the *Detections* page,
and you should contact your {kib} administrator.

NOTE: For *self-managed* {stack} deployments only, this message may be
displayed when the <<detections-permissions, `xpack.security.enabled`>>
setting is not enabled in the `elasticsearch.yml` file. For more information, see <<detections-on-prem-requirements>>.
