= Detections and Alerts (beta)

beta[]

Use the Detections feature to create and manage rules, and view the alerts
these rules create. Rules periodically search indices (such as `endgame-*` and
`filebeat-*`) for suspicious source events, and create alerts when a rule's
conditions are met. When an alert is created, its status is `Open`. To help
track investigations, an alert's status can be set as `Open`, `In progress`, or
`Closed` (see <<detection-alert-status>>).

In addition to creating <<rules-ui-create, your own rules>>, enable
<<load-prebuilt-rules, Elastic prebuilt rules>> to immediately start detecting
suspicious activity. For detailed information on all the prebuilt rules, see the
<<prebuilt-rules>> section. Once the prebuilt rules are loaded and
running, <<tuning-detection-signals>> and <<detections-ui-exceptions>> explain
how to modify the rules to reduce false positives and get a better set of
actionable alerts. You can also use exceptions and value lists when creating or
modifying your own rules.

There are two special prebuilt rules you need to know about:

* <<elastic-endpoint-prebuilt-rule, *Elastic Endpoint Security*>>:
Automatically creates an alert from all incoming Elastic Endpoint alerts. To
receive Elastic Endpoint alerts, you must install the Endpoint agent on your
hosts (see <<install-endpoint>>).
+
When this rule is enabled, the following Endpoint events are displayed as
detection alerts:
+
** Malware Prevention Alert
** Malware Detection Alert
+
NOTE: When you load the prebuilt rules, this is the only rule that is enabled
by default.

* <<external-alerts, *External Alerts*>>: Automatically creates an alert for
all incoming third-party system alerts (for example, Suricata alerts).

If you want to receive notifications via external systems, such as Slack or
email, when alerts are created, use the {kib}
{kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html[Alerting and Actions] framework.

NOTE: To use {kib} Alerting for detection alert notifications, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license].

After rules have started running, you can monitor their executions to verify
they are functioning correctly, as well as view, manage, and troubleshoot
alerts (see <<alerts-ui-manage>> and <<alerts-ui-monitor>>).

You can create and manage rules and alerts via the UI or the
<<rule-api-overview, Detections API>>.

[[det-engine-terminology]]
== Terminology

Actions::
Sends notifications via other systems when a detection alert is created, such
as email, Slack, PagerDuty, and Webhook.

[[detection-alert-def]]
Detection alerts::
{es-sec} produced alerts. Detection alerts are never received from external
systems. When a rule's conditions are met, {es-sec} writes a detection alert to
an Elasticsearch `.signals` index.
+
[NOTE]
==============
Detection alert indices are created for each {kib} space. The naming convention
is: `.siem-signals-<space name>`. For the default space, the alerts index is
named `.siem-signals-default`.
==============

Detection rules::
Background tasks that run periodically and produce alerts when suspicious
activity is detected.

Endpoint exceptions::
<<term-exceptions, Exceptions>> added to both rules and Endpoint agents on
hosts. Endpoint exceptions can only be added when:

* Endpoint agents are installed on the hosts.
* The Elastic Endpoint Security rule is activated.

[[term-exceptions]]
Exceptions::
Added to rules to prevent specific source event field values from generating
alerts.

External alerts::
Alerts {es-sec} receives from external systems, such as Suricata.

=== Resolve UI error messages

Depending on your privileges and whether detection system indices have already
been created for the {kib} space, you might see an error message  when you try
to open the *Detections* page.

*`Letâ€™s set up your detection engine`*

If you see this message, a user with specific privileges must visit the 
*Detections* page before you can view detection rules and alerts.
See <<enable-detections-ui>> for a list of all the requirements. 

NOTE: For *on-premises* {stack} deployments only, this message may be displayed 
when the
<<detections-permissions, `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey`>> 
setting has not been added to the `kibana.yml` file. For more information, see <<detections-on-prem-requirements>>.

*`Detection engine permissions required`*

If you see this message, you do not have the
<<detections-permissions, required privileges>> to view the *Detections* page, 
and you should contact your {kib} administrator.

NOTE: For *on-premises* {stack} deployments only, this message may be
displayed when the <<detections-permissions, `xpack.security.enabled`>>
setting is not enabled in the `elasticsearch.yml` file. For more information, see <<detections-on-prem-requirements>>.
