== Detection Alerts Migration API

After upgrading {kib}, the latest {elastic-sec} features will be available for any newly generated detection alerts. However, in order to enable new features for existing detection alerts, migration may be necessary. See {security-guide}/upgrade-intro.html[Upgrade {elastic-sec}] for instructions specific to your upgrade.

Migrating detection alerts is performed at the index level and requires the following steps:

1. <<migration-1, Determine which indices to migrate>>
2. <<migration-2, Initiate migrations>>
3. <<migration-3, Finalize migrations>>
4. <<migration-4, Migration cleanup>> (optional)

[[migration-1]]

=== Determine which indices to migrate
You can use the Migration Status API to determine which indices contain detection alerts of a particular age, along with migration info for each of those indices.

==== Response example

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "indices": [
    {
      "index": ".siem-signals-default-000002",
      "version": 15,
      "signal_versions": [
        {
          "version": 15,
          "count": 100
        },
        {
          "version": 16,
          "count": 87
        }
      ],
      "migrations": [
        {
          "id": "924f7c50-505f-11eb-ae0a-3fa2e626a51d",
          "status": "pending",
          "version": 16,
          "updated": "2021-01-06T20:41:37.173Z"
        }
      ],
      "is_outdated": true
    },
    {
      "index": ".siem-signals-default-000003",
      "version": 16,
      "signal_versions": [
        {
          "version": 16,
          "count": 54
        }
      ],
      "migrations": [],
      "is_outdated": false
    }
  ]
}
--------------------------------------------------
The above response shows two indices: `.siem-signals-default-000002` is outdated, with multiple versions of detection alerts and a pending migration, and `.siem-signals-default-000003`, which is up to date as the current write index.

NOTE: Indices that do not contain detection alerts in the specified range will be filtered from the response.

With the above info, we can compile a list of indices that we wish to migrate.

*Find outdated detection alerts with threat intelligence data*

After upgrading to {stack} version 7.15.x from release versions 7.12.0 through 7.14.2, you need to migrate detection alerts enriched with threat intelligence data to ensure threat intelligence properly displays in {elastic-sec}. Run this query to find outdated detection alerts with threat intelligence data:

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------
GET .siem-signals-{KIBANA SPACE ID}/_search
{
  "query": {
    "nested": {
      "path": "threat.indicator",
      "query": {
        "exists": {
          "field": "threat.indicator.matched.*"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------


[[migration-2]]
[float]
=== Initiate migrations

Migrations are initiated per index. While the process is neither destructive nor interferes with existing data, it may be resource-intensive. As such, it is recommended that you plan your migrations accordingly.

[float]
==== Request

`POST <kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/signals/migration`

[float]
==== Request body

[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
|Name |Type |Description | Required

|`index` |String[]|Array of index names to migrate|Yes
|`size`|Integer|Number of alerts to migrate per batch. Corresponds to the `source.size` option on the {ref}/docs-reindex.html[Reindex API]|No
|`requests_per_second`|Integer|The throttle for the migration task in sub-requests per second. Corresponds to `requests_per_second` on the {ref}/docs-reindex.html[Reindex API]| No
|`slices`|Integer|The number of subtasks for the migration task. Corresponds to `slices` on the {ref}/docs-reindex.html[Reindex API]|No
|==============================================

[float]
==== Response example

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "indices": [
    {
      "index": ".siem-signals-default-000001",
      "migration_id": "923f7c50-505f-11eb-ae0a-3fa2e626a51d",
      "migration_index": ".siem-signals-default-000001-r000016"
    }
  ]
}
--------------------------------------------------
The response will include, for each index specified, an ID and destination index for the migration, and an error if unsuccessful.

[[migration-3]]
[float]
=== Finalize migrations

The finalization endpoint replaces the original index's alias with the successfully migrated index's alias. The endpoint is idempotent; therefore, it can safely be used to poll a given migration and, upon completion, finalize it.

NOTE: The original indices are not removed as part of this step. After verifying the integrity of the migrated index, you can use the <<migration-4, Migration cleanup>> endpoint to apply a 30-day deletion policy to the original, outdated index.

NOTE: If an unsuccessful migration is finalized, a deletion policy will be applied to its index, causing it to be deleted after 30 days.

[float]
==== Request

`POST <kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/signals/finalize_migration`

[float]
==== Request body

[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
|Name |Type |Description | Required

|`migration_ids` |String[]|Array of `migration_id`s to finalize|Yes
|==============================================

[float]
==== Response example

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "migrations": [
    {
      "id": "924f7c50-505f-11eb-ae0a-3fa2e626a51d",
      "completed": true,
      "destinationIndex": ".siem-signals-default-000002-r000016",
      "status": "success",
      "sourceIndex": ".siem-signals-default-000002",
      "version": 16,
      "updated": "2021-01-06T22:05:56.859Z"
    }
  ]
}
--------------------------------------------------
Finalized migrations will show a response of `completed: true`, with a corresponding `status`. If the migration is still running when you attempt to finalize it, its response will show as `completed: false`.

[float]
[[migration-4]]
=== Migration cleanup

Migrations favor data integrity over shard size. Consequently, unused or orphaned indices are artifacts of the migration process. A successful migration will result in both the old and new indices being present. As such, the old, orphaned index can (and likely should) be deleted.

While you can delete these indices manually, the endpoint accomplishes this task by applying a deletion policy to the relevant index, causing it to be deleted after 30 days. It also deletes other artifacts specific to the migration implementation.
