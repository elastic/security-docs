IMPORTANT: This API has been deprecated since version 8.2, and is scheduled for end of life in 2024. Please use the <<bulk-actions-rules-api-action, bulk action API>> instead.

[WARNING]
====
When used with {kibana-ref}/api-keys.html[API key] authentication, the user's key gets assigned to the affected rules. If the user's key gets deleted or the user becomes inactive, the rules will stop running.

If the API key that is used for authorization has different privileges than the key that created or most recently updated the rule, the rule behavior might change.

Updates multiple rules.

You can use `PUT` or `PATCH` methods to bulk update rules, where:

* `PUT` replaces the original rule and deletes fields that are not specified.
* `PATCH` updates the specified fields.

A JSON array where each element includes:

* The `id` or `rule_id` field of the rule you want to update.
* The <<rules-api-update, fields>> you want to modify.

IMPORTANT: If you call `PUT` to update rules, all unspecified fields are
deleted. You cannot modify the `id` or `rule_id` values.

For `PATCH` calls, any of the fields can be modified. For `PUT` calls,
some fields are required (see <<rules-api-update>> for a list of required
fields).

|==============================================

[[bulk-actions-rules-api-dry-run]]
[discrete]
==== Dry run mode
Enable dry run mode to verify that bulk actions can be applied to specified rules. Certain rules, such as prebuilt Elastic rules, can't be edited and will return errors in the request response. Error details will contain an explanation, the rule name and/or ID, and additional troubleshooting information. 

To enable dry run mode on a request, add the query parameter `dry_run=true` to the end of the request URL. Rules specified in the request will be temporarily updated. These updates won't be written to {es}.


IMPORTANT: Dry run mode is not supported for the `export` bulk action. A `400` error will be returned in the request response.

`interval`: Frequency of rule execution. For example, `"1h"` means the rule runs every hour. 

`lookback`: Additional look-back time that the rule analyzes. For example, `"10m"` means the rule analyzes the last 10 minutes of data in addition to the frequency interval.

If `interval` is set to `"10m"` and `lookback` to `"1m"`, then the rule runs every 5 minutes but analyzes the documents added to indices during the last 11 minutes.

Both `interval` and `lookback` have a format of `"{integer}{time_unit}"`, where accepted time units are `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, and `h` for hours. The integer must be positive and larger than 0. Examples: `"45s"`, `"30m"`, `"6h"`

===== Optional `action` fields

[width="100%",options="header"]

|Name |Type |Description

|frequency |String a|Object containing an action’s frequency:

* `summary` (Boolean, required): Defines whether to send notifications alert summaries or for individual alerts. 

* `notifyWhen` (String, required`): Defines how often rules run actions. Valid values are:

[[throttle-schema-bulk]]
===== `throttle` schema

`throttle` defines the maximum interval in which a rule's actions are executed. It accepts the following values:

[NOTE]

=========

The rule-level `throttle` field is deprecated in {elastic-sec} 8.8 and is scheduled for end of life in Q4 of 2024.

In {elastic-sec} 8.8 and later, you can use the (<<optional-actions-fields-bulk-update,`frequency`>>) field to define frequencies for individual actions. Actions without frequencies will acquire a converted version of the rule's `throttle` field. In the response, the converted `throttle` setting appears in the individual actions' `frequency` field.

=========

- `"rule"`: Execute actions on each rule execution

- `"1h"`: Execute actions once per hour

- `"1d"`: Execute actions once per day

- `"7d"`: Execute actions once per week

[discrete]
===== Example requests

*Example 1*

The following request activates all rules with the `test` tag:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
POST api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_action
{
  "query": "alert.attributes.tags: \"test\"",
  "action": "enable"
}
--------------------------------------------------

[discrete]
===== Response code

`200`::
    Indicates a successful call.

[discrete]
===== Response payload

For `enable`, `disable`, `delete`, `edit`, and `duplicate` actions, a JSON object containing the action's outcome:

- `attributes.summary.total`: Total number of rules matching the bulk action
- `attributes.summary.succeeded`: Number of successful outcomes (number of rules that were enabled, deleted, or updated)
- `attributes.summary.failed`: Number of failed outcomes
- `attributes.summary.skipped`: Number of rules that were skipped due to various reasons (explained below)
- `attributes.results.created`: Rule objects that were created during the action's execution
- `attributes.results.updated`: Rule objects that were updated during the action's execution
- `attributes.results.deleted`: Rule objects that were deleted during the action's execution
- `attributes.results.skipped`: Rules that were skipped during the action's execution

A rule can only be `skipped` when the bulk action to be performed on it results in nothing being done. For example, if the `edit` action is used to add a tag to a rule that already has that tag, or to delete an index pattern that is not specified in a rule. Objects returned in `attributes.results.skipped` will only include rules' `id`, `name`, and `skip_reason`.

*Example 3, Dry run*

The following request will validate that the `add_index_patterns` bulk action can be successfully applied to three rules. Each rule (specified by its rule ID) is different: one is a prebuilt Elastic rule, another is a custom machine learning rule, and another is a custom query rule. Because dry run mode is enabled, changes to these rules will not be permanent or saved to {es}.

[discrete]
===== Response code

`500`::
    Indicates a partial bulk action failure.

[discrete]
===== Response payload

The `attributes.errors` section of the response shows that two rules failed to update and one succeeded. The same results would be returned if you ran the request without dry run mode enabled.
Notice that there are no arrays in `attributes.results`. In dry run mode, rule updates are not applied and saved to {es}, so the endpoint wouldn't return results for rules that have been `updated`, `created`, or `deleted`.
