== Detections API

You can create rules that automatically turn events and external alerts sent to
{es-sec} into detection alerts. These alerts are displayed on the Detections
page.

For more information about the differences between events,
external alerts, and detection alerts, see the
{glossary}/terms.html[Elastic Glossary].

The API has these endpoints:

* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/rules` - Detection rules CRUD functions
* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/index` - Signal index operations
(used to store detection alerts)
* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/tags` - Aggregates and returns rule
tags
* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/rules/_import` - Imports rules from an
`.ndjson` file
* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/rules/_export` - Exports rules to an
`.ndjson` file
* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/privileges` - Returns the user's
{kib} space and signal index permissions, and whether the user is authenticated
* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/signals` - Aggregates, queries, and
returns alerts, and updates their statuses
* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged` - Loads and retrieves
the status of Elastic <<prebuilt-rules, prebuilt rules>>

TIP: You can view and download a Detections API Postman collection
https://github.com/elastic/examples/tree/master/Security%20Analytics/SIEM-examples/Detections-API[here].

=== Kibana role requirements

To create and run rules, the user role for the {kib} space must have:

* {kib} space `All` privileges for the `Security` and `Saved Objects Management`
features (see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges]).
* `read` and `write` privileges for the `.siem-signals-*` index (the system index
used for storing detection alerts created from rules).



See <<detections-permissions-section>> for a complete list of requirements.
