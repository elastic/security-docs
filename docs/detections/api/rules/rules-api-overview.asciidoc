== Detections API

You can create rules that automatically turn events and external alerts sent to
{elastic-sec} into detection alerts. These alerts are displayed on the Detections
page.

For more information about the differences between events,
external alerts, and detection alerts, see the
{glossary}/terms.html[Elastic Glossary].

The API has these endpoints:

* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/rules` - Detection rules CRUD functions
* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/index` - Signal index operations
(used to store detection alerts)
* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/tags` - Aggregates and returns rule
tags
* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/rules/_import` - Imports rules from an
`.ndjson` file
* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/rules/_export` - Exports rules to an
`.ndjson` file
* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/privileges` - Returns the user's
{kib} space and signal index permissions, and whether the user is authenticated
* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/signals` - Aggregates, queries, and
returns alerts, and updates their statuses
* `<kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/rules/prepackaged` - Loads and retrieves
the status of Elastic <<prebuilt-rules, prebuilt rules>>

TIP: You can view and download a Detections API Postman collection

=== Authentication
This API supports both key- and token-based authentication.

To use key-based authentication, create an {kibana-ref}/api-keys.html[API key], then specify the key in the header of your API calls.

To use token-based authentication, provide a username and password; this automatically creates an API key that matches the current user's privileges.

In both cases, the API key is subsequently used for authorization when the rule runs.

[WARNING]
====
If the API key has different privileges than the key that created or most recently updated the rule, the rule behavior might change.

If the key that created the rule gets deleted, or the user that created the rule becomes inactive, the rule will stop running.

=== Kibana role requirements

To create and run rules, the user role for the {kib} space must have:

* {kib} space `All` privileges for the `Security` and `Saved Objects Management`
features (see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges]).
* `read` and `write` privileges for the `.siem-signals-*` index (the system index
used for storing detection alerts created from rules).



See <<detections-permissions-section>> for a complete list of requirements.
