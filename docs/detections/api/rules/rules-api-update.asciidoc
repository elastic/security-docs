[[rules-api-update]]
=== Update rule

WARNING: This API supports {kibana-ref}/api.html#token-api-authentication[Token-based authentication] only.

Updates an existing detection rule.

NOTE: Console supports only Elasticsearch APIs. Console doesn't allow interactions with {kib} APIs. You must use `curl` or another HTTP tool instead. For more information, refer to {kibana-ref}/console-kibana.html[Run {es} API requests].

You can use `PUT` or `PATCH` methods to update rules, where:

* `PUT` replaces the original rule and deletes fields that are not specified.
* `PATCH` updates the specified fields.

==== Request URL

`PUT <kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/rules`

`PATCH <kibana host>:<port>/api/detection_engine/rules`

==== Request body

A JSON object with:

* The `id` or `rule_id` field of the rule you want to update.
* The fields you want to modify.

IMPORTANT: If you call `PUT` to update a rule, all unspecified fields are
deleted. You cannot modify the `id` or `rule_id` values.

For `PATCH` calls any of the fields can be modified, whereas for `PUT` calls
some fields are required.

be one of the following:

* `low`: Alerts that are of interest but generally not considered to be
security incidents
* `medium`: Alerts that require investigation
* `high`: Alerts that require immediate investigation
* `critical`: Alerts that indicate it is highly likely a security incident has
occurred

|type |String a|Data type on which the rule is based:

* `eql`: EQL query (see {ref}/eql.html[Event Query Language]).
* `query`: query with or without additional filters.
* `saved_query`: saved search, identified in the `saved_id` field.
* `machine_learning`: rule based on a {ml} job's anomaly scores.

at least the number of results specified in the `value` field.

You can use Boolean `and` and `or` logic to define the conditions for when
matching fields and values generate alerts. Sibling `entries` objects
are evaluated using `or` logic, whereas multiple entries in a single `entries`
object use `and` logic. See <<threat-match-example, below>> for an example that
uses both `and` and `or` logic.
