== Exceptions API

Exceptions are associated with detection and endpoint rules, and are used to
prevent a rule from generating an alert from incoming events even when the
rule's other criteria are met. They can be used to reduce the number of false
positives, and to prevent trusted processes and network activity from
generating unnecessary alerts.

Exceptions are made up of:

* *Exception containers*: A container for related exceptions. In general, a
single exception container contains all the exception items relevant for
a subset of rules. For example, a container can be used to group together
network-related exceptions that are relevant for a large number of network
rules. The container can then be associated with all the relevant rules.
* *Exception items*: The query (fields, values, and logic) used to prevent
rules from generating alerts. When an exception item's query evaluates to
`true`, the rule does not generate an alert.

For detection rules, you can also use <<lists-api-overview, lists>> to define
rule exceptions. A list holds multiple values of the same {es} data type, such
as IP addresses, which are used to determine when an exception prevents an
alert from being generated.

IMPORTANT: You cannot use lists with endpoint rule exceptions.

NOTE: Only exception containers can be associated with rules. You cannot
directly associate an exception item or a
<<lists-api-create-container, list container>> with a rule. To use list
exceptions, create an exception item that references the relevant list
container (see this <<list-item-example, example request>>).

The following diagram represents the logical relationship between rules,
detections, and lists, and shows the boolean operator used between sibling
entities:

=== Exceptions requirements 

Before you start working with exceptions that use value lists, you must create the `.lists` and `.items` data streams for the relevant {kib} space. To learn how to do this, go to <<lists-index-api-overview>>. 
 
Once these data streams are created, your role needs privileges to manage rules. Refer to <<enable-detections-ui>> for a complete list of requirements.
