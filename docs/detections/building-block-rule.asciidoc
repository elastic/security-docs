== About building-block rules

Create building-block rules when you do not want to see their generated alerts
in the UI. This is useful when you want:

* A record of low-risk alerts without producing noise in the Alerts table.
* Rules that execute on the alert indices (`.siem-signals-<kibana space>-*`).
You can then use building-block rules to create hidden alerts that act as a
basis for an 'ordinary' rule to generate visible alerts.

add the index pattern for alert indices:

=== View building-block alerts in the UI

. Go to *Security* -> *Detections*
. In the Alert table, select _Additional filters_ ->
_Include building-block alerts_.

NOTE: On a building-block Rule details page, the rule's alerts are displayed (by
default, _Include building-block alerts_ is selected).
