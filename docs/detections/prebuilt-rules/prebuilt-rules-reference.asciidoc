|<<unusual-web-request, Unusual Web Request>> |A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual URL that indicates unusual web browsing activity. This can be due to initial access, persistence, command- and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, in a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack, when a trusted website is compromised to target a particular sector or organization, targeted users may receive emails with uncommon URLs for trusted websites. These URLs can be used to download and run a payload. When malware is already running, it may send requests to uncommon URLs on trusted websites the malware uses for command-and-control communication. When rare URLs are observed being requested for a local web server by a remote source, these can be due to web scanning, enumeration or attack traffic, or they can be due to bots and web scrapers which are part of common Internet background traffic. |[Elastic] [Network] [Threat Detection] [ML]  |7.7.0 |3 <<unusual-web-request-history, Version history>>

|<<unusual-web-user-agent, Unusual Web User Agent>> |A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual user agent indicating web browsing activity by an unusual process other than a web browser. This can be due to persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. Uncommon user agents coming from remote sources to local destinations are often the result of scanners, bots, and web scrapers, which are part of common Internet background traffic. Much of this is noise, but more targeted attacks on websites using tools like Burp or SQLmap can sometimes be discovered by spotting uncommon user agents. Uncommon user agents in traffic from local sources to remote destinations can be any number of things, including harmless programs like weather monitoring or stock-trading programs. However, uncommon user agents from local sources can also be due to malware or scanning activity. |[Elastic] [Network] [Threat Detection] [ML]  |7.7.0 |3 <<unusual-web-user-agent-history, Version history>>

|<<unusual-windows-network-activity, Unusual Windows Network Activity>> |Identifies Windows processes that do not usually use the network but have unexpected network activity, which can indicate command-and-control, lateral movement, persistence, or data exfiltration activity.

|<<web-application-suspicious-activity-no-user-agent, Web Application Suspicious Activity: No User Agent>> |A request to a web application server contained no identifying user agent string. |[Elastic] [APM]  |7.6.0 |4 <<web-application-suspicious-activity-no-user-agent-history, Version history>>

|<<web-application-suspicious-activity-post-request-declined, Web Application Suspicious Activity: POST Request Declined>> |A POST request to web application returned a 403 response, which indicates the web application declined to process the request because the action requested was not allowed. |[Elastic] [APM]  |7.6.0 |4 <<web-application-suspicious-activity-post-request-declined-history, Version history>>

|<<web-application-suspicious-activity-unauthorized-method, Web Application Suspicious Activity: Unauthorized Method>> |A request to web application returned a 405 response which indicates the web application declined to process the request because the HTTP method is not allowed for the resource. |[Elastic] [APM]  |7.6.0 |4 <<web-application-suspicious-activity-unauthorized-method-history, Version history>>

|<<web-application-suspicious-activity-sqlmap-user-agent, Web Application Suspicious Activity: sqlmap User Agent>> |This is an example of how to detect an unwanted web client user agent. This search matches the user agent for sqlmap 1.3.11, which is a popular FOSS tool for testing web applications for SQL injection vulnerabilities. |[Elastic] [APM]  |7.6.0 |4 <<web-application-suspicious-activity-sqlmap-user-agent-history, Version history>>

|<<webserver-access-logs-deleted, WebServer Access Logs Deleted>> |Identifies the deletion of WebServer access logs.

|<<zoom-meeting-with-no-passcode, Zoom Meeting with no Passcode>> |This rule identifies Zoom meetings that are created without a passcode. Meetings without a passcode are susceptible to Zoombombing. Zoombombing is carried out by taking advantage of Zoom sessions that are not protected with a passcode. Zoombombing refers to the unwanted, disruptive intrusion, generally by Internet trolls and hackers, into a video conference call. In a typical Zoombombing incident, a teleconferencing session is hijacked by the insertion of material that is lewd, obscene, racist, or antisemitic in nature, typically resulting of the shutdown of the session. |[Elastic] [Application] [Communication] [Zoom] [Continuous Monitoring] [SecOps] [Configuration Audit]  |7.10.0 |1
