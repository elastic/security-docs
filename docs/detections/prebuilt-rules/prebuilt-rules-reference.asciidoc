They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. This rule identifies attempts to remove a kernel module. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Linux], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Defense Evasion], [Data Source: Elastic Endgame], [Data Source: Elastic Defend] |None |109

|<<keychain-password-retrieval-via-command-line, Keychain Password Retrieval via Command Line>> |Adversaries may collect keychain storage data from a system to in order to acquire credentials. Keychains are the built-in way for macOS to keep track of users' passwords and credentials for many services and features, including Wi-Fi and website passwords, secure notes, certificates, and Kerberos. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: macOS], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Credential Access], [Data Source: Elastic Defend] |None |108

|<<kirbi-file-creation, Kirbi File Creation>> |Identifies the creation of .kirbi files. The creation of this kind of file is an indicator of an attacker running Kerberos ticket dump utilities, such as Mimikatz, and precedes attacks such as Pass-The-Ticket (PTT), which allows the attacker to impersonate users using Kerberos tickets. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Windows], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Credential Access], [Data Source: Elastic Defend], [Data Source: Sysmon], [Data Source: SentinelOne] |8.11.0 |107

|<<kubernetes-anonymous-request-authorized, Kubernetes Anonymous Request Authorized>> |This rule detects when an unauthenticated user request is authorized within the cluster. Attackers may attempt to use anonymous accounts to gain initial access to the cluster or to avoid attribution of their activities within the cluster. This rule excludes the /healthz, /livez and /readyz endpoints which are commonly accessed anonymously. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Initial Access], [Tactic: Defense Evasion] |None |6

|<<kubernetes-container-created-with-excessive-linux-capabilities, Kubernetes Container Created with Excessive Linux Capabilities>> |This rule detects a container deployed with one or more dangerously permissive Linux capabilities. An attacker with the ability to deploy a container with added capabilities could use this for further execution, lateral movement, or privilege escalation within a cluster. The capabilities detected in this rule have been used in container escapes to the host machine. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] |None |4

|<<kubernetes-denied-service-account-request, Kubernetes Denied Service Account Request>> |This rule detects when a service account makes an unauthorized request for resources from the API server. Service accounts follow a very predictable pattern of behavior. A service account should never send an unauthorized request to the API server. This behavior is likely an indicator of compromise or of a problem within the cluster. An adversary may have gained access to credentials/tokens and this could be an attempt to access or create resources to facilitate further movement or execution within the cluster. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Discovery] |None |5

|<<kubernetes-exposed-service-created-with-type-nodeport, Kubernetes Exposed Service Created With Type NodePort>> |This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a service as type NodePort. The NodePort service allows a user to externally expose a set of labeled pods to the internet. This creates an open port on every worker node in the cluster that has a pod for that service. When external traffic is received on that open port, it directs it to the specific pod through the service representing it. A malicious user can configure a service as type Nodeport in order to intercept traffic from other pods or nodes, bypassing firewalls and other network security measures configured for load balancers within a cluster. This creates a direct method of communication between the cluster and the outside world, which could be used for more malicious behavior and certainly widens the attack surface of your cluster. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Persistence] |None |203

|<<kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostipc, Kubernetes Pod Created With HostIPC>> |This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a pod using the host IPC namespace. This gives access to data used by any pod that also use the hosts IPC namespace. If any process on the host or any processes in a pod uses the hosts inter-process communication mechanisms (shared memory, semaphore arrays, message queues, etc.), an attacker can read/write to those same mechanisms. They may look for files in /dev/shm or use ipcs to check for any IPC facilities being used. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] |None |203

|<<kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostnetwork, Kubernetes Pod Created With HostNetwork>> |This rules detects an attempt to create or modify a pod attached to the host network. HostNetwork allows a pod to use the node network namespace. Doing so gives the pod access to any service running on localhost of the host. An attacker could use this access to snoop on network activity of other pods on the same node or bypass restrictive network policies applied to its given namespace. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] |None |203

|<<kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostpid, Kubernetes Pod Created With HostPID>> |This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a pod attached to the host PID namespace. HostPID allows a pod to access all the processes running on the host and could allow an attacker to take malicious action. When paired with ptrace this can be used to escalate privileges outside of the container. When paired with a privileged container, the pod can see all of the processes on the host. An attacker can enter the init system (PID 1) on the host. From there, they could execute a shell and continue to escalate privileges to root. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] |None |203

|<<kubernetes-pod-created-with-a-sensitive-hostpath-volume, Kubernetes Pod created with a Sensitive hostPath Volume>> |This rule detects when a pod is created with a sensitive volume of type hostPath. A hostPath volume type mounts a sensitive file or folder from the node to the container. If the container gets compromised, the attacker can use this mount for gaining access to the node. There are many ways a container with unrestricted access to the host filesystem can escalate privileges, including reading data from other containers, and accessing tokens of more privileged pods. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] |None |203

|<<kubernetes-privileged-pod-created, Kubernetes Privileged Pod Created>> |This rule detects when a user creates a pod/container running in privileged mode. A highly privileged container has access to the node's resources and breaks the isolation between containers. If compromised, an attacker can use the privileged container to gain access to the underlying host. Gaining access to the host may provide the adversary with the opportunity to achieve follow-on objectives, such as establishing persistence, moving laterally within the environment, or setting up a command and control channel on the host. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] |None |203

|<<kubernetes-suspicious-assignment-of-controller-service-account, Kubernetes Suspicious Assignment of Controller Service Account>> |This rule detects a request to attach a controller service account to an existing or new pod running in the kube-system namespace. By default, controllers running as part of the API Server utilize admin-equivalent service accounts hosted in the kube-system namespace. Controller service accounts aren't normally assigned to running pods and could indicate adversary behavior within the cluster. An attacker that can create or modify pods or pod controllers in the kube-system namespace, can assign one of these admin-equivalent service accounts to a pod and abuse their powerful token to escalate privileges and gain complete cluster control. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] |None |6

|<<kubernetes-suspicious-self-subject-review, Kubernetes Suspicious Self-Subject Review>> |This rule detects when a service account or node attempts to enumerate their own permissions via the selfsubjectaccessreview or selfsubjectrulesreview APIs. This is highly unusual behavior for non-human identities like service accounts and nodes. An adversary may have gained access to credentials/tokens and this could be an attempt to determine what privileges they have to facilitate further movement or execution within the cluster. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Discovery] |None |203

|<<kubernetes-user-exec-into-pod, Kubernetes User Exec into Pod>> |This rule detects a user attempt to establish a shell session into a pod using the 'exec' command. Using the 'exec' command in a pod allows a user to establish a temporary shell session and execute any process/commands in the pod. An adversary may call bash to gain a persistent interactive shell which will allow access to any data the pod has permissions to, including secrets. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution] |None |203

|<<lsass-memory-dump-creation, LSASS Memory Dump Creation>> |Identifies the creation of a Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (lsass.exe) default memory dump. This may indicate a credential access attempt via trusted system utilities such as Task Manager (taskmgr.exe) and SQL Dumper (sqldumper.exe) or known pentesting tools such as Dumpert and AndrewSpecial. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Windows], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Credential Access], [Data Source: Elastic Endgame], [Resources: Investigation Guide], [Data Source: Elastic Defend], [Data Source: Sysmon] |None |109

|<<lsass-memory-dump-handle-access, LSASS Memory Dump Handle Access>> |Identifies handle requests for the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) object access with specific access masks that many tools with a capability to dump memory to disk use (0x1fffff, 0x1010, 0x120089). This rule is tool agnostic as it has been validated against a host of various LSASS dump tools such as SharpDump, Procdump, Mimikatz, Comsvcs etc. It detects this behavior at a low level and does not depend on a specific tool or dump file name. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Windows], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Credential Access], [Resources: Investigation Guide] |None |110

|<<lsass-process-access-via-windows-api, LSASS Process Access via Windows API>> |Identifies access attempts to the LSASS handle, which may indicate an attempt to dump credentials from LSASS memory. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Windows], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Credential Access], [Tactic: Execution], [Data Source: Elastic Defend] |None |7

|<<lateral-movement-via-startup-folder, Lateral Movement via Startup Folder>> |Identifies suspicious file creations in the startup folder of a remote system.
