|<<unusual-linux-username, Unusual Linux Username>> |A machine learning job detected activity for a username that is not normally active, which can indicate unauthorized changes, activity by unauthorized users, lateral movement, or compromised credentials. In many organizations, new usernames are not often created apart from specific types of system activities, such as creating new accounts for new employees. These user accounts quickly become active and routine. Events from rarely used usernames can point to suspicious activity. Additionally, automated Linux fleets tend to see activity from rarely used usernames only when personnel log in to make authorized or unauthorized changes, or threat actors have acquired credentials and log in for malicious purposes. Unusual usernames can also indicate pivoting, where compromised credentials are used to try and move laterally from one host to another. |[Elastic] [Host] [Linux] [Threat Detection] [ML]  |7.7.0 |7 <<unusual-linux-username-history, Version history>>

|<<unusual-linux-web-activity, Unusual Linux Web Activity>> |A machine learning job detected an unusual web URL request from a Linux host, which can indicate malware delivery and execution. Wget and cURL are commonly used by Linux programs to download code and data. Most of the time, their usage is entirely normal. Generally, because they use a list of URLs, they repeatedly download from the same locations. However, Wget and cURL are sometimes used to deliver Linux exploit payloads, and threat actors use these tools to download additional software and code. For these reasons, unusual URLs can indicate unauthorized downloads or threat activity. |[Elastic] [Host] [Linux] [Threat Detection] [ML]  |7.7.0 |4 <<unusual-linux-web-activity-history, Version history>>

|<<unusual-source-ip-for-a-user-to-logon-from, Unusual Source IP for a User to Logon from>> |A machine learning job detected a user logging in from an IP address that is unusual for the user. This can be due to credentialed access via a compromised account when the user and the threat actor are in different locations. An unusual source IP address for a username could also be due to lateral movement when a compromised account is used to pivot between hosts. |[Elastic] [Authentication] [Threat Detection] [ML]  |7.14.0 |1

|<<unusual-sudo-activity, Unusual Sudo Activity>> |Looks for sudo activity from an unusual user context. An unusual sudo user could be due to troubleshooting activity or it could be a sign of credentialed access via compromised accounts. |[Elastic] [Host] [Linux] [Threat Detection] [ML]  |7.10.0 |2 <<unusual-sudo-activity-history, Version history>>

|<<unusual-web-request, Unusual Web Request>> |A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual URL that indicates unusual web browsing activity. This can be due to initial access, persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, in a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack, when a trusted website is compromised to target a particular sector or organization, targeted users may receive emails with uncommon URLs for trusted websites. These URLs can be used to download and run a payload. When malware is already running, it may send requests to uncommon URLs on trusted websites the malware uses for command-and-control communication. When rare URLs are observed being requested for a local web server by a remote source, these can be due to web scanning, enumeration or attack traffic, or they can be due to bots and web scrapers which are part of common Internet background traffic. |[Elastic] [Network] [Threat Detection] [ML]  |7.7.0 |4 <<unusual-web-request-history, Version history>>

|<<unusual-web-user-agent, Unusual Web User Agent>> |A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual user agent indicating web browsing activity by an unusual process other than a web browser. This can be due to persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. Uncommon user agents coming from remote sources to local destinations are often the result of scanners, bots, and web scrapers, which are part of common Internet background traffic. Much of this is noise, but more targeted attacks on websites using tools like Burp or SQLmap can sometimes be discovered by spotting uncommon user agents. Uncommon user agents in traffic from local sources to remote destinations can be any number of things, including harmless programs like weather monitoring or stock-trading programs. However, uncommon user agents from local sources can also be due to malware or scanning activity. |[Elastic] [Network] [Threat Detection] [ML]  |7.7.0 |4 <<unusual-web-user-agent-history, Version history>>
