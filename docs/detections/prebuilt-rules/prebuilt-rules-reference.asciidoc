|<<kernel-module-load-via-insmod, Kernel module load via insmod>> |Detects the use of the insmod binary to load a Linux kernel object file. Threat actors can use this binary, given they have root privileges, to load a rootkit on a system providing them with complete control and the ability to hide from security products. Manually loading a kernel module in this manner should not be at all common and can indicate suspcious or malicious behavior. |[Elastic] [Host] [Linux] [Threat Detection] [Persistence] [Rootkit]  |8.4.0 |100 <<kernel-module-load-via-insmod-history, Version history>>

|<<keychain-password-retrieval-via-command-line, Keychain Password Retrieval via Command Line>> |Adversaries may collect keychain storage data from a system to in order to acquire credentials.

|<<kubernetes-anonymous-request-authorized, Kubernetes Anonymous Request Authorized>> |This rule detects when an unauthenticated user request is authorized within the cluster. Attackers may attempt to use anonymous accounts to gain initial access to the cluster or to avoid attribution of their activities within the cluster. This rule excludes the /healthz, /livez and /readyz endpoints which are commonly accessed anonymously. |[Elastic] [Kubernetes] [Continuous Monitoring] [Execution] [Initial Access] [Defense Evasion]  |8.5.0 |1

|<<kubernetes-denied-service-account-request, Kubernetes Denied Service Account Request>> |This rule detects when a service account makes an unauthorized request for resources from the API server. Service accounts follow a very predictable pattern of behavior. A service account should never send an unauthorized request to the API server. This behavior is likely an indicator of compromise or of a problem within the cluster. An adversary may have gained access to credentials/tokens and this could be an attempt to access or create resources to facilitate further movement or execution within the cluster. |[Elastic] [Kubernetes] [Continuous Monitoring] [Discovery]  |8.5.0 |2 <<kubernetes-denied-service-account-request-history, Version history>>

|<<kubernetes-exposed-service-created-with-type-nodeport, Kubernetes Exposed Service Created With Type NodePort>> |This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a service as type NodePort. The NodePort service allows a user to externally expose a set of labeled pods to the internet. This creates an open port on every worker node in the cluster that has a pod for that service. When external traffic is received on that open port, it directs it to the specific pod through the service representing it. A malicious user can configure a service as type Nodeport in order to intercept traffic from other pods or nodes, bypassing firewalls and other network security measures configured for load balancers within a cluster. This creates a direct method of communication between the cluster and the outside world, which could be used for more malicious behavior and certainly widens the attack surface of your cluster. |[Elastic] [Kubernetes] [Continuous Monitoring] [Execution] [Persistence]  |8.4.0 |100 <<kubernetes-exposed-service-created-with-type-nodeport-history, Version history>>

|<<kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostipc, Kubernetes Pod Created With HostIPC>> |This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a pod using the host IPC namespace. This gives access to data used by any pod that also use the host�s IPC namespace. If any process on the host or any processes in a pod uses the host�s inter-process communication mechanisms (shared memory, semaphore arrays, message queues, etc.), an attacker can read/write to those same mechanisms. They may look for files in /dev/shm or use ipcs to check for any IPC facilities being used. |[Elastic] [Kubernetes] [Continuous Monitoring] [Execution] [Privilege Escalation]  |8.4.0 |100 <<kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostipc-history, Version history>>

|<<kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostnetwork, Kubernetes Pod Created With HostNetwork>> |This rules detects an attempt to create or modify a pod attached to the host network. HostNetwork allows a pod to use the node network namespace. Doing so gives the pod access to any service running on localhost of the host. An attacker could use this access to snoop on network activity of other pods on the same node or bypass restrictive network policies applied to its given namespace. |[Elastic] [Kubernetes] [Continuous Monitoring] [Execution] [Privilege Escalation]  |8.4.0 |100 <<kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostnetwork-history, Version history>>

|<<kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostpid, Kubernetes Pod Created With HostPID>> |This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a pod attached to the host PID namespace. HostPID allows a pod to access all the processes running on the host and could allow an attacker to take malicious action. When paired with ptrace this can be used to escalate privileges outside of the container. When paired with a privileged container, the pod can see all of the processes on the host. An attacker can enter the init system (PID 1) on the host. From there, they could execute a shell and continue to escalate privileges to root. |[Elastic] [Kubernetes] [Continuous Monitoring] [Execution] [Privilege Escalation]  |8.4.0 |100 <<kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostpid-history, Version history>>

|<<kubernetes-pod-created-with-a-sensitive-hostpath-volume, Kubernetes Pod created with a Sensitive hostPath Volume>> |This rule detects when a pod is created with a sensitive volume of type hostPath. A hostPath volume type mounts a sensitive file or folder from the node to the container. If the container gets compromised, the attacker can use this mount for gaining access to the node. There are many ways a container with unrestricted access to the host filesystem can escalate privileges, including reading data from other containers, and accessing tokens of more privileged pods. |[Elastic] [Kubernetes] [Continuous Monitoring] [Execution] [Privilege Escalation]  |8.4.0 |100 <<kubernetes-pod-created-with-a-sensitive-hostpath-volume-history, Version history>>

|<<kubernetes-privileged-pod-created, Kubernetes Privileged Pod Created>> |This rule detects when a user creates a pod/container running in privileged mode. A highly privileged container has access to the node's resources and breaks the isolation between containers. If compromised, an attacker can use the privileged container to gain access to the underlying host. Gaining access to the host may provide the adversary with the opportunity to achieve follow-on objectives, such as establishing persistence, moving laterally within the environment, or setting up a command and control channel on the host. |[Elastic] [Kubernetes] [Continuous Monitoring] [Execution] [Privilege Escalation]  |8.4.0 |100 <<kubernetes-privileged-pod-created-history, Version history>>

|<<kubernetes-suspicious-assignment-of-controller-service-account, Kubernetes Suspicious Assignment of Controller Service Account>> |This rule detects a request to attach a controller service account to an existing or new pod running in the kube-system namespace. By default, controllers running as part of the API Server utilize admin-equivalent service accounts hosted in the kube-system namespace. Controller service accounts aren't normally assigned to running pods and could indicate adversary behavior within the cluster. An attacker that can create or modify pods or pod controllers in the kube-system namespace, can assign one of these admin-equivalent service accounts to a pod and abuse their powerful token to escalate privileges and gain complete cluster control. |[Elastic] [Kubernetes] [Continuous Monitoring] [Execution] [Privilege Escalation]  |8.5.0 |2 <<kubernetes-suspicious-assignment-of-controller-service-account-history, Version history>>

|<<kubernetes-suspicious-self-subject-review, Kubernetes Suspicious Self-Subject Review>> |This rule detects when a service account or node attempts to enumerate their own permissions via the selfsubjectaccessreview or selfsubjectrulesreview APIs. This is highly unusual behavior for non-human identities like service accounts and nodes. An adversary may have gained access to credentials/tokens and this could be an attempt to determine what privileges they have to facilitate further movement or execution within the cluster. |[Elastic] [Kubernetes] [Continuous Monitoring] [Discovery]  |8.4.0 |100 <<kubernetes-suspicious-self-subject-review-history, Version history>>

|<<kubernetes-user-exec-into-pod, Kubernetes User Exec into Pod>> |This rule detects a user attempt to establish a shell session into a pod using the 'exec' command. Using the 'exec' command in a pod allows a user to establish a temporary shell session and execute any process/commands in the pod. An adversary may call bash to gain a persistent interactive shell which will allow access to any data the pod has permissions to, including secrets. |[Elastic] [Kubernetes] [Continuous Monitoring] [Execution]  |8.3.0 |100 <<kubernetes-user-exec-into-pod-history, Version history>>

|<<lsass-memory-dump-creation, LSASS Memory Dump Creation>> |Identifies the creation of a Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (lsass.exe) default memory dump.

This rule is tool agnostic as it has been validated against a host of various LSASS dump tools such as SharpDump, Procdump, Mimikatz, Comsvcs etc. It detects this behavior at a low level and does not depend on a specific tool or dump file name. |[Elastic] [Host] [Windows] [Threat Detection] [Credential Access] [has_guide]  |8.2.0 |101 <<lsass-memory-dump-handle-access-history, Version history>>

|<<lateral-movement-via-startup-folder, Lateral Movement via Startup Folder>> |Identifies suspicious file creations in the startup folder of a remote system.

|<<unusual-web-request, Unusual Web Request>> |A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual URL that indicates unusual web browsing activity. This can be due to initial access, persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, in a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack, when a trusted website is compromised to target a particular sector or organization, targeted users may receive emails with uncommon URLs for trusted websites. These URLs can be used to download and run a payload. When malware is already running, it may send requests to uncommon URLs on trusted websites the malware uses for command-and-control communication. When rare URLs are observed being requested for a local web server by a remote source, these can be due to web scanning, enumeration or attack traffic, or they can be due to bots and web scrapers which are part of common Internet background traffic. |[Elastic] [Network] [Threat Detection] [ML] [Command and Control]  |7.7.0 |100 <<unusual-web-request-history, Version history>>

|<<unusual-web-user-agent, Unusual Web User Agent>> |A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual user agent indicating web browsing activity by an unusual process other than a web browser. This can be due to persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. Uncommon user agents coming from remote sources to local destinations are often the result of scanners, bots, and web scrapers, which are part of common Internet background traffic. Much of this is noise, but more targeted attacks on websites using tools like Burp or SQLmap can sometimes be discovered by spotting uncommon user agents. Uncommon user agents in traffic from local sources to remote destinations can be any number of things, including harmless programs like weather monitoring or stock-trading programs. However, uncommon user agents from local sources can also be due to malware or scanning activity. |[Elastic] [Network] [Threat Detection] [ML] [Command and Control]  |7.7.0 |100 <<unusual-web-user-agent-history, Version history>>

|<<unusual-windows-network-activity, Unusual Windows Network Activity>> |Identifies Windows processes that do not usually use the network but have unexpected network activity, which can indicate command-and-control, lateral movement, persistence, or data exfiltration activity.
