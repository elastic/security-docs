|<<interactive-exec-command-launched-against-a-running-container, Interactive Exec Command Launched Against A Running Container>> |This rule detects interactive 'exec' events launched against a container using the 'exec' command. Using the 'exec' command in a pod allows a user to establish a temporary shell session and execute any process/command inside the container. This rule specifically targets higher-risk interactive commands that allow real-time interaction with a container's shell. A malicious actor could use this level of access to further compromise the container environment or attempt a container breakout. |[Data Source: Elastic Defend for Containers], [Domain: Container], [OS: Linux], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Execution] |8.8.0 |2

|<<interactive-logon-by-an-unusual-process, Interactive Logon by an Unusual Process>> |Identifies interactive logon attempt with alternate credentials and by an unusual process.

|<<kernel-driver-load, Kernel Driver Load>> |Detects the loading of a Linux kernel module through system calls. Threat actors may leverage Linux kernel modules to load a rootkit on a system providing them with complete control and the ability to hide from security products. As other rules monitor for the addition of Linux kernel modules through system utilities or .ko files, this rule covers the gap that evasive rootkits leverage by monitoring for kernel module additions on the lowest level through auditd_manager. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Linux], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Persistence], [Tactic: Defense Evasion], [Rule Type: BBR] |8.3.0 |2

|<<kernel-load-or-unload-via-kexec-detected, Kernel Load or Unload via Kexec Detected>> |This detection rule identifies the usage of kexec, helping to uncover unauthorized kernel replacements and potential compromise of the system's integrity. Kexec is a Linux feature that enables the loading and execution of a different kernel without going through the typical boot process. Malicious actors can abuse kexec to bypass security measures, escalate privileges, establish persistence or hide their activities by loading a malicious kernel, enabling them to tamper with the system's trusted state, allowing e.g. a VM Escape. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Linux], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Persistence], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation], [Tactic: Defense Evasion], [Data Source: Elastic Defend] |8.3.0 |5

|<<kernel-module-load-via-insmod, Kernel Module Load via insmod>> |Detects the use of the insmod binary to load a Linux kernel object file. Threat actors can use this binary, given they have root privileges, to load a rootkit on a system providing them with complete control and the ability to hide from security products. Manually loading a kernel module in this manner should not be at all common and can indicate suspcious or malicious behavior. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Linux], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Persistence], [Threat: Rootkit], [Data Source: Elastic Endgame], [Data Source: Elastic Defend] |8.3.0 |107

|<<kernel-module-removal, Kernel Module Removal>> |Kernel modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. This rule identifies attempts to remove a kernel module. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Linux], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Defense Evasion], [Data Source: Elastic Endgame], [Data Source: Elastic Defend] |8.3.0 |107

|<<keychain-password-retrieval-via-command-line, Keychain Password Retrieval via Command Line>> |Adversaries may collect keychain storage data from a system to in order to acquire credentials.

|<<kirbi-file-creation, Kirbi File Creation>> |Identifies the creation of .kirbi files. The creation of this kind of file is an indicator of an attacker running Kerberos ticket dump utilities, such as Mimikatz, and precedes attacks such as Pass-The-Ticket (PTT), which allows the attacker to impersonate users using Kerberos tickets. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Windows], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Credential Access], [Data Source: Elastic Defend], [Rule Type: BBR] |8.3.0 |2

|<<kubernetes-anonymous-request-authorized, Kubernetes Anonymous Request Authorized>> |This rule detects when an unauthenticated user request is authorized within the cluster. Attackers may attempt to use anonymous accounts to gain initial access to the cluster or to avoid attribution of their activities within the cluster. This rule excludes the /healthz, /livez and /readyz endpoints which are commonly accessed anonymously. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Initial Access], [Tactic: Defense Evasion] |8.4.0 |6

|<<kubernetes-container-created-with-excessive-linux-capabilities, Kubernetes Container Created with Excessive Linux Capabilities>> |This rule detects a container deployed with one or more dangerously permissive Linux capabilities. An attacker with the ability to deploy a container with added capabilities could use this for further execution, lateral movement, or privilege escalation within a cluster. The capabilities detected in this rule have been used in container escapes to the host machine. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] |8.4.0 |4

|<<kubernetes-denied-service-account-request, Kubernetes Denied Service Account Request>> |This rule detects when a service account makes an unauthorized request for resources from the API server. Service accounts follow a very predictable pattern of behavior. A service account should never send an unauthorized request to the API server. This behavior is likely an indicator of compromise or of a problem within the cluster. An adversary may have gained access to credentials/tokens and this could be an attempt to access or create resources to facilitate further movement or execution within the cluster. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Discovery] |8.4.0 |5

|<<kubernetes-exposed-service-created-with-type-nodeport, Kubernetes Exposed Service Created With Type NodePort>> |This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a service as type NodePort. The NodePort service allows a user to externally expose a set of labeled pods to the internet. This creates an open port on every worker node in the cluster that has a pod for that service. When external traffic is received on that open port, it directs it to the specific pod through the service representing it. A malicious user can configure a service as type Nodeport in order to intercept traffic from other pods or nodes, bypassing firewalls and other network security measures configured for load balancers within a cluster. This creates a direct method of communication between the cluster and the outside world, which could be used for more malicious behavior and certainly widens the attack surface of your cluster. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Persistence] |8.4.0 |203

|<<kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostipc, Kubernetes Pod Created With HostIPC>> |This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a pod using the host IPC namespace. This gives access to data used by any pod that also use the hosts IPC namespace. If any process on the host or any processes in a pod uses the hosts inter-process communication mechanisms (shared memory, semaphore arrays, message queues, etc.), an attacker can read/write to those same mechanisms. They may look for files in /dev/shm or use ipcs to check for any IPC facilities being used. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] |8.4.0 |203

|<<kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostnetwork, Kubernetes Pod Created With HostNetwork>> |This rules detects an attempt to create or modify a pod attached to the host network. HostNetwork allows a pod to use the node network namespace. Doing so gives the pod access to any service running on localhost of the host. An attacker could use this access to snoop on network activity of other pods on the same node or bypass restrictive network policies applied to its given namespace. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] |8.4.0 |203

|<<kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostpid, Kubernetes Pod Created With HostPID>> |This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a pod attached to the host PID namespace. HostPID allows a pod to access all the processes running on the host and could allow an attacker to take malicious action. When paired with ptrace this can be used to escalate privileges outside of the container. When paired with a privileged container, the pod can see all of the processes on the host. An attacker can enter the init system (PID 1) on the host. From there, they could execute a shell and continue to escalate privileges to root. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] |8.4.0 |203

|<<kubernetes-pod-created-with-a-sensitive-hostpath-volume, Kubernetes Pod created with a Sensitive hostPath Volume>> |This rule detects when a pod is created with a sensitive volume of type hostPath. A hostPath volume type mounts a sensitive file or folder from the node to the container. If the container gets compromised, the attacker can use this mount for gaining access to the node. There are many ways a container with unrestricted access to the host filesystem can escalate privileges, including reading data from other containers, and accessing tokens of more privileged pods. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] |8.4.0 |203

|<<kubernetes-privileged-pod-created, Kubernetes Privileged Pod Created>> |This rule detects when a user creates a pod/container running in privileged mode. A highly privileged container has access to the node's resources and breaks the isolation between containers. If compromised, an attacker can use the privileged container to gain access to the underlying host. Gaining access to the host may provide the adversary with the opportunity to achieve follow-on objectives, such as establishing persistence, moving laterally within the environment, or setting up a command and control channel on the host. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] |8.4.0 |203

|<<kubernetes-suspicious-assignment-of-controller-service-account, Kubernetes Suspicious Assignment of Controller Service Account>> |This rule detects a request to attach a controller service account to an existing or new pod running in the kube-system namespace. By default, controllers running as part of the API Server utilize admin-equivalent service accounts hosted in the kube-system namespace. Controller service accounts aren't normally assigned to running pods and could indicate adversary behavior within the cluster. An attacker that can create or modify pods or pod controllers in the kube-system namespace, can assign one of these admin-equivalent service accounts to a pod and abuse their powerful token to escalate privileges and gain complete cluster control. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution], [Tactic: Privilege Escalation] |8.4.0 |6

|<<kubernetes-suspicious-self-subject-review, Kubernetes Suspicious Self-Subject Review>> |This rule detects when a service account or node attempts to enumerate their own permissions via the selfsubjectaccessreview or selfsubjectrulesreview APIs. This is highly unusual behavior for non-human identities like service accounts and nodes. An adversary may have gained access to credentials/tokens and this could be an attempt to determine what privileges they have to facilitate further movement or execution within the cluster. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Discovery] |8.4.0 |203

|<<kubernetes-user-exec-into-pod, Kubernetes User Exec into Pod>> |This rule detects a user attempt to establish a shell session into a pod using the 'exec' command. Using the 'exec' command in a pod allows a user to establish a temporary shell session and execute any process/commands in the pod. An adversary may call bash to gain a persistent interactive shell which will allow access to any data the pod has permissions to, including secrets. |[Data Source: Kubernetes], [Tactic: Execution] |8.4.0 |203

|<<lsass-memory-dump-creation, LSASS Memory Dump Creation>> |Identifies the creation of a Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (lsass.exe) default memory dump. This may indicate a credential access attempt via trusted system utilities such as Task Manager (taskmgr.exe) and SQL Dumper (sqldumper.exe) or known pentesting tools such as Dumpert and AndrewSpecial. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Windows], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Credential Access], [Data Source: Elastic Endgame], [Resources: Investigation Guide], [Data Source: Elastic Defend] |8.3.0 |107

|<<lsass-memory-dump-handle-access, LSASS Memory Dump Handle Access>> |Identifies handle requests for the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) object access with specific access masks that many tools with a capability to dump memory to disk use (0x1fffff, 0x1010, 0x120089). This rule is tool agnostic as it has been validated against a host of various LSASS dump tools such as SharpDump, Procdump, Mimikatz, Comsvcs etc. It detects this behavior at a low level and does not depend on a specific tool or dump file name. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Windows], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Credential Access], [Resources: Investigation Guide] |8.3.0 |109

|<<lsass-process-access-via-windows-api, LSASS Process Access via Windows API>> |Identifies access attempts to the LSASS handle, which may indicate an attempt to dump credentials from LSASS memory. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Windows], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Credential Access], [Tactic: Execution], [Data Source: Elastic Defend] |8.7.0 |6

|<<lateral-movement-via-startup-folder, Lateral Movement via Startup Folder>> |Identifies suspicious file creations in the startup folder of a remote system. An adversary could abuse this to move laterally by dropping a malicious script or executable that will be executed after a reboot or user logon. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Windows], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Lateral Movement], [Data Source: Elastic Endgame], [Data Source: Elastic Defend] |8.3.0 |106

|<<launch-agent-creation-or-modification-and-immediate-loading, Launch Agent Creation or Modification and Immediate Loading>> |An adversary can establish persistence by installing a new launch agent that executes at login by using launchd or launchctl to load a plist into the appropriate directories. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: macOS], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Persistence], [Data Source: Elastic Defend] |8.3.0 |105

|<<launchdaemon-creation-or-modification-and-immediate-loading, LaunchDaemon Creation or Modification and Immediate Loading>> |Indicates the creation or modification of a launch daemon, which adversaries may use to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: macOS], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Persistence], [Data Source: Elastic Defend] |8.3.0 |105

|<<linux-group-creation, Linux Group Creation>> |Identifies attempts to create a new group. Attackers may create new groups to establish persistence on a system. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Linux], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Persistence], [Resources: Investigation Guide] |8.3.0 |3

|<<linux-restricted-shell-breakout-via-linux-binary-s, Linux Restricted Shell Breakout via Linux Binary(s)>> |Identifies the abuse of a Linux binary to break out of a restricted shell or environment by spawning an interactive system shell. The activity of spawning a shell from a binary is not common behavior for a user or system administrator, and may indicate an attempt to evade detection, increase capabilities or enhance the stability of an adversary. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Linux], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Execution], [Data Source: Elastic Endgame], [Data Source: Elastic Defend] |8.3.0 |111

|<<linux-secret-dumping-via-gdb, Linux Secret Dumping via GDB>> |This rule monitors for potential memory dumping through gdb. Attackers may leverage memory dumping techniques to attempt secret extraction from privileged processes. Tools that display this behavior include "truffleproc" and "bash-memory-dump". This behavior should not happen by default, and should be investigated thoroughly. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Linux], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Credential Access], [Data Source: Elastic Defend], [Rule Type: BBR] |8.3.0 |1

|<<linux-init-pid-1-secret-dump-via-gdb, Linux init (PID 1) Secret Dump via GDB>> |This rule monitors for the potential memory dump of the init process (PID 1) through gdb. Attackers may leverage memory dumping techniques to attempt secret extraction from privileged processes. Tools that display this behavior include "truffleproc" and "bash-memory-dump". This behavior should not happen by default, and should be investigated thoroughly. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Linux], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Credential Access], [Data Source: Elastic Defend] |8.3.0 |3

|<<local-account-tokenfilter-policy-disabled, Local Account TokenFilter Policy Disabled>> |Identifies registry modification to the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy policy. If this value exists (which doesn't by default) and is set to 1, then remote connections from all local members of Administrators are granted full high-integrity tokens during negotiation. |[Domain: Endpoint], [OS: Windows], [Use Case: Threat Detection], [Tactic: Defense Evasion], [Tactic: Lateral Movement], [Data Source: Elastic Endgame], [Data Source: Elastic Defend] |8.3.0 |6

|<<local-scheduled-task-creation, Local Scheduled Task Creation>> |Indicates the creation of a scheduled task.
