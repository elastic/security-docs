In many organizations, new usernames are not often created apart from specific types of system activities, such as creating new accounts for new employees. These user accounts quickly become active and routine. Events from rarely used usernames can point to suspicious activity. Additionally, automated Linux fleets tend to see activity from rarely used usernames only when personnel log in to make authorized or unauthorized changes, or threat actors have acquired credentials and log in for malicious purposes. Unusual usernames can also indicate pivoting, where compromised credentials are used to try and move laterally from one host to another. |[Elastic] [Linux] [ML]  |7.7.0 |2 <<unusual-linux-username-history, Version history>>

|<<unusual-linux-web-activity, Unusual Linux Web Activity>> |A machine learning job detected an unusual web URL request from a Linux host, which can indicate malware delivery and execution. Wget and cURL are commonly used by Linux programs to download code and data. Most of the time, their usage is entirely normal. Generally, because they use a list of URLs, they repeatedly download from the same locations. However, Wget and cURL are sometimes used to deliver Linux exploit payloads, and threat actors use these tools to download additional software and code. For these reasons, unusual URLs can indicate unauthorized downloads or threat activity. |[Elastic] [Linux] [ML]  |7.7.0 |2 <<unusual-linux-web-activity-history, Version history>>

|<<unusual-network-destination-domain-name, Unusual Network Destination Domain Name>> |A machine learning job detected an unusual network destination domain name. This can be due to initial access, persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, when a user clicks on a link in a phishing email or opens a malicious document, a request may be sent to download and run a payload from an uncommon web server name. When malware is already running, it may send requests to an uncommon DNS domain the malware uses for command-and-control communication. |[Elastic] [ML] [Packetbeat]  |7.7.0 |2 <<unusual-network-destination-domain-name-history, Version history>>

|<<unusual-web-request, Unusual Web Request>> |A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual URL that indicates unusual web browsing activity. This can be due to initial access, persistence, command- and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, in a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack, when a trusted website is compromised to target a particular sector or organization, targeted users may receive emails with uncommon URLs for trusted websites. These URLs can be used to download and run a payload. When malware is already running, it may send requests to uncommon URLs on trusted websites the malware uses for command-and-control communication. When rare URLs are observed being requested for a local web server by a remote source, these can be due to web scanning, enumeration or attack traffic, or they can be due to bots and web scrapers which are part of common Internet background traffic. |[Elastic] [ML] [Packetbeat]  |7.7.0 |2 <<unusual-web-request-history, Version history>>

|<<unusual-web-user-agent, Unusual Web User Agent>> |A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual user agent indicating web browsing activity by an unusual process other than a web browser. This can be due to persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. Uncommon user agents coming from remote sources to local destinations are often the result of scanners, bots, and web scrapers, which are part of common Internet background traffic. Much of this is noise, but more targeted attacks on websites using tools like Burp or SQLmap can sometimes be discovered by spotting uncommon user agents. Uncommon user agents in traffic from local sources to remote destinations can be any number of things, including harmless programs like weather monitoring or stock-trading programs. However, uncommon user agents from local sources can also be due to malware or scanning activity. |[Elastic] [ML] [Packetbeat]  |7.7.0 |2 <<unusual-web-user-agent-history, Version history>>

|<<unusual-windows-network-activity, Unusual Windows Network Activity>> |Identifies Windows processes that do not usually use the network but have unexpected network activity, which can indicate command-and-control, lateral movement, persistence, or data exfiltration activity.

|<<user-added-as-owner-for-azure-service-principal, User Added as Owner for Azure Service Principal>> |Identifies when a user is added as an owner for an Azure service principal. The service principal object defines what the application can do in the specific tenant, who can access the application, and what resources the app can access. A service principal object is created when an application is given permission to access resources in a tenant. An adversary may add a user account as an owner for a service principal and use that account in order to define what an application can do in the Azure AD tenant. |[Elastic] [Azure] [Continuous Monitoring] [SecOps] [Configuration Audit]  |7.10.0 |1
