==== Potential false positives

WinRM is a dual-use protocol that can be used for benign or malicious activity. It's important to baseline your environment to determine the amount of noise to expect from this tool.

==== Rule query


[source,js]
----------------------------------
sequence by host.id with maxspan=30s [network where process.pid ==
4 and network.direction == "incoming" and destination.port in
(5985, 5986) and network.protocol == "http" and not source.address in
("::1", "127.0.0.1") ] [process where event.type == "start" and
process.parent.name : "winrshost.exe" and not process.name :
"conhost.exe"]
