==== Potential false positives

Suspending the recording of a trail may be done by a system or network
administrator. Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname
should be making changes in your environment. Trail suspensions from unfamiliar
users or hosts should be investigated. If a known behavior is causing false
positives, it can be excluded from the rule.

==== Investigation guide

The AWS Filebeat module must be enabled to use this rule.
