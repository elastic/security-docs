=== Unusual Time or Day for an RDP Session

A machine learning job has detected an RDP session started at an usual time or weekday. An RDP session at an unusual time could be followed by other suspicious activities, so catching this is a good first step in detecting a larger attack.

==== Setup


The rule requires the Lateral Movement Detection integration assets to be installed, as well as file and Windows RDP process events collected by the Elastic Defend integration.  


*Lateral Movement Detection Setup*

The Lateral Movement Detection integration detects lateral movement activity by identifying abnormalities in file and Windows RDP events. Anomalies are detected using Elastic's Anomaly Detection feature.


*Prerequisite Requirements:*

- Fleet is required for Lateral Movement Detection.
- To configure Fleet Server refer to the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html[documentation].
- Windows RDP process events collected by the https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/endpoint[Elastic Defend] integration.
- To install Elastic Defend, refer to the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/install-endpoint.html[documentation].


*The following steps should be executed to install assets associated with the Lateral Movement Detection integration:*

- Go to the Kibana homepage. Under Management, click Integrations.
- In the query bar, search for Lateral Movement Detection and select the integration to see more details about it.
- Under Settings, click Install Lateral Movement Detection assets and follow the prompts to install the assets.


*Anomaly Detection Setup*

Before you can enable rules for Lateral Movement Detection, you'll need to enable the corresponding Anomaly Detection jobs.
- Before enabling the Anomaly Detection jobs, confirm that the Pivot Transform asset is installed and actively gathering data in the destination index `ml-rdp-lmd`.
- Go to the Kibana homepage. Under Analytics, click Machine Learning.
- Under Anomaly Detection, click Jobs, and then click "Create job". Select the Data View containing your transformed RDP process data i.e.`ml-rdp-lmd`.
- If the selected Data View contains events that match the query in https://github.com/elastic/integrations/blob/main/packages/lmd/kibana/ml_module/lmd-ml.json[this] configuration file, you will see a card for Lateral Movement Detection under "Use preconfigured jobs".
- Keep the default settings and click "Create jobs" to start the anomaly detection jobs and datafeeds.
