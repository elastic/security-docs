==== Potential false positives

It's recommended that you rotate your access keys periodically to help keep your storage account secure. Normal key rotation can be exempted from the rule. An abnormal time frame and/or a key rotation from unfamiliar users, hosts, or locations should be investigated.

==== Investigation guide

The Azure Filebeat module must be enabled to use this rule.
