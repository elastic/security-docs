==== Potential false positives

Network ACLs may be deleted by a network administrator. Verify whether the user
identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes in your
environment. Network ACL deletions from unfamiliar users or hosts should be
investigated. If a known behavior is causing false positives, it can be
excluded from the rule.

==== Investigation guide

The AWS Filebeat module must be enabled to use this rule.
