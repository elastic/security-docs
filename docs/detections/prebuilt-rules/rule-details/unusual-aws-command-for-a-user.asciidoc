=== Unusual AWS Command for a User

A machine learning job detected an AWS API command that, while not inherently
suspicious or abnormal, is being made by a user that does not normally use the
command. This can be the result of compromised credentials or keys as someone
uses a valid account to persist, move laterally, or exfiltrate data.

==== Potential false positives

New or unusual user command activity can be due to manual troubleshooting or
reconfiguration, changes in cloud automation scripts or workflows, adoption of
new services, or changes in the way services are used.

==== Investigation guide

Alerts from this rule indicate an AWS API command or method call that is rare
and unusual for the calling IAM user. Here are some possible avenues of
investigation:

* Consider the user as identified by the `user.name` field. Is this command
part of an expected workflow for the user context? Examine the user identity in
the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` field and the access key id in the
`aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` field, which can help identify the
precise user context. The user agent details in the `user_agent.original` field
may also indicate what type of client made the request.
* Consider the source IP address and geolocation for the calling user who
issued the command. Do they look normal for the calling user? If the source is
an EC2 IP address, is it associated with an EC2 instance in one of your
accounts or could it be sourcing from an EC2 instance not under your control?
If it is an authorized EC2 instance, is the activity associated with normal
behavior for the instance role or roles? Are there any other alerts or signs of
suspicious activity involving this instance?
* Consider the time of day. If the user is a human, not a program or script,
did the activity take place during normal working hours?
* Examine the history of the command. If the command, which is visible in the
`event.action field`, manifested only very recently, it might be part of a new
automation module or script. If its usage rate is consistent - for example, if
it appears in small numbers on a weekly or monthly basis - it might be part of
a housekeeping or maintenance process.
* Examine the request parameters. These may provide indications as to the
source of the program or the nature of the tasks it is performing.
