[source,markdown]
----------------------------------
## Config

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

==== Rule query


[source,js]
----------------------------------
process where event.type == "start" and process.name : "netsh.exe" and
process.args : ("firewall", "advfirewall") and process.args :
"group=Network Discovery" and process.args : "enable=Yes"
