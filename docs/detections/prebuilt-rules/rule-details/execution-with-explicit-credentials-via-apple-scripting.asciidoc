=== Execution with Explicit Credentials via Apple Scripting

Identifies execution of the security_authtrampoline process via the Apple script interpreter (osascript). This occurs when programs use AuthorizationExecute-WithPrivileges from the Security.framework to run another program with root privileges. It should not be run by itself, as this is a sign of execution with explicit logon credentials.
