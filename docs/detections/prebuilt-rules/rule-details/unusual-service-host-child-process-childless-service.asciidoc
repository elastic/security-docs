Changes to Windows services or a rarely executed child process.

==== Investigation guide


[source,markdown]
----------------------------------
## Config

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

==== Rule query


[source,js]
----------------------------------
process where event.type in ("start", "process_started") and
process.parent.name : "svchost.exe" and /* based on svchost
service arguments -s svcname where the service is known to be
childless */ process.parent.args :
("WdiSystemHost","LicenseManager",
"StorSvc","CDPSvc","cdbhsvc","BthAvctpSvc","SstpSvc","WdiServiceHost",
"imgsvc","TrkWks","WpnService","IKEEXT","PolicyAgent","CryptSvc",
"netprofm","ProfSvc","StateRepository","camsvc","LanmanWorkstation",
"NlaSvc","EventLog","hidserv","DisplayEnhancementService","ShellHWDete
ction", "AppHostSvc","fhsvc","CscService","PushToInstall") and
/* unknown FPs can be added here */ not process.name :
("WerFault.exe","WerFaultSecure.exe","wermgr.exe")
