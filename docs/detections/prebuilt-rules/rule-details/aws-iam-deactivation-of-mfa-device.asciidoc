==== Potential false positives

A MFA device may be deactivated by a system or network administrator. Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment. MFA device deactivations from unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.
