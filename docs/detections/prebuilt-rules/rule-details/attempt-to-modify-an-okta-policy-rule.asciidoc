==== Investigation guide



*Triage and analysis*



*Investigating Attempt to Modify an Okta Policy Rule*


The modification of an Okta policy rule can be an indication of malicious activity as it may aim to weaken an organization's security controls.


*Possible investigation steps:*


- Identify the actor related to the alert by reviewing `okta.actor.id`, `okta.actor.type`, `okta.actor.alternate_id`, or `okta.actor.display_name` fields in the alert.
- Review the `okta.client.user_agent.raw_user_agent` field to understand the device and software used by the actor.
- Examine the `okta.outcome.reason` field for additional context around the modification attempt.
- Check the `okta.outcome.result` field to confirm the rule modification attempt.
- Check if there are multiple rule modification attempts from the same actor or IP address (`okta.client.ip`).
- Check for successful logins immediately following the modification attempt.
- Verify whether the actor's activity aligns with typical behavior or if any unusual activity took place around the time of the modification attempt.


*False positive analysis:*


- Check if there were issues with the Okta system at the time of the modification attempt. This could indicate a system error rather than a genuine threat activity.
- Check the geographical location (`okta.request.ip_chain.geographical_context`) and time of the modification attempt. If these match the actor's normal behavior, it might be a false positive.
- Verify the actor's administrative rights to ensure they are correctly configured.


*Response and remediation:*


- If unauthorized modification is confirmed, initiate the incident response process.
- Immediately lock the affected actor account and require a password change.
- Consider resetting MFA tokens for the actor and require re-enrollment.
- Check if the compromised account was used to access or alter any sensitive data or systems.
- If a specific modification technique was used, ensure your systems are patched or configured to prevent such techniques.
- Assess the criticality of affected services and servers.
- Work with your IT team to minimize the impact on users and maintain business continuity.
- If multiple accounts are affected, consider a broader reset or audit of MFA tokens.
- Implement security best practices https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/10/9-admin-best-practices-to-keep-your-org-secure/[outlined] by Okta.
- Using the incident response data, update logging and audit policies to improve the mean time to detect (MTTD) and the mean time to respond (MTTR).

==== Setup


The Okta Fleet integration, Filebeat module, or similarly structured data is required to be compatible with this rule.
