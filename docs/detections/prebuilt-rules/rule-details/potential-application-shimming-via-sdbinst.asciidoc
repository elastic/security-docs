=== Potential Application Shimming via Sdbinst

The Application Shim was created to allow for backward compatibility of software as the operating system codebase changes over time. This Windows functionality has been abused by attackers to stealthily gain persistence and arbitrary code execution in legitimate Windows processes.

==== Setup


[source, markdown]
----------------------------------

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2,
events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until version 8.2.
Hence for this rule to work effectively, users will need to add a custom ingest pipeline to populate
`event.ingested` to @timestamp.
For more details on adding a custom ingest pipeline refer - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/data-streams-pipeline-tutorial.html

----------------------------------

==== Rule query


[source, js]
----------------------------------
process where host.os.type == "windows" and event.type == "start" and process.name : "sdbinst.exe" and
  not (process.args : "-m" and process.args : "-bg") and
  not process.args : "-mm"
