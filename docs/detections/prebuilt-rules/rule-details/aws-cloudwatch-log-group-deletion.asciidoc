==== Potential false positives

Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making
changes in your environment. Log group deletions from unfamiliar users or hosts
should be investigated. If a known behavior is causing false positives, it can
be excluded from the rule.

==== Investigation guide

The AWS Filebeat module must be enabled to use this rule.
