Identifies Linux binary flock abuse to break out from restricted environments by spawning an interactive system shell.The flock utility allows us to manage advisory file locks in shell scripts or on the command line and the activity of spawing a shell is not a standard use of this binary by a user or system administrator. It indicates a potentially malicious actor attempting to improve the capabilities or stability of their access.
