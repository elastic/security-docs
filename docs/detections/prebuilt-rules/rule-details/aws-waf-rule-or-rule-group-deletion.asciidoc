==== Potential false positives

WAF rules or rule groups may be deleted by a system or network administrator. Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment. Rule deletions from unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.

==== Investigation guide

*Config*

The AWS Fleet integration, Filebeat module, or similarly structured data is required to be compatible with this rule.
