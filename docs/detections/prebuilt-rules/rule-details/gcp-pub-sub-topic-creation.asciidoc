==== Potential false positives

Topic creations may be done by a system or network administrator. Verify whether the user email, resource name, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment. Topic creations from unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.

==== Investigation guide

The GCP Filebeat module must be enabled to use this rule.
