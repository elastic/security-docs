=== GCP Storage Bucket Permissions Modification

Identifies when the Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions are modified for a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) storage bucket. An adversary may modify the permissions on a storage bucket to weaken their target's security controls or an administrator may inadvertently modify the permissions, which could lead to data exposure or loss.
