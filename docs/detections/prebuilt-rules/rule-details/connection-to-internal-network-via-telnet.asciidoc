==== Potential false positives

Telnet can be used for both benign or malicious purposes. Telnet is included by default in some Linux distributions, so its presence is not inherently suspicious. The use of Telnet to manage devices remotely has declined in recent years in favor of more secure protocols such as SSH. Telnet usage by non-automated tools or frameworks may be suspicious.

==== Rule query


[source,js]
----------------------------------
sequence by process.entity_id [process where process.name ==
"telnet" and event.type == "start"] [network where process.name ==
"telnet" and cidrmatch(destination.ip, "10.0.0.0/8",
"172.16.0.0/12", "192.168.0.0/16", "FE80::/10") and not
cidrmatch(destination.ip, "127.0.0.0/8", "::1/128")]
