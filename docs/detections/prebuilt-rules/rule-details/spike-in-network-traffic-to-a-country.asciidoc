=== Spike in Network Traffic To a Country

A machine learning job detected an unusually large spike in network activity to one destination country in the network logs. This could be due to unusually large amounts of reconnaissance or enumeration traffic. Data exfiltration activity may also produce such a surge in traffic to a destination country which does not normally appear in network traffic or business work-flows. Malware instances and persistence mechanisms may communicate with command-and-control (C2) infrastructure in their country of origin, which may be an unusual destination country for the source network.

==== Potential false positives

Business workflows that occur very occasionally, and involve an unusual surge in network traffic to one destination country, can trigger this alert. A new business workflow or a surge in business activity in a particular country may trigger this alert. Business travelers who roam to many countries for brief periods may trigger this alert if they engage in volumetric network activity.
