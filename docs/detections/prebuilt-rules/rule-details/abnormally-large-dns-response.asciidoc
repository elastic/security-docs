=== Abnormally Large DNS Response

Specially crafted DNS requests can manipulate a known overflow vulnerability in some Windows DNS servers which result in Remote Code Execution (RCE) or a Denial of Service (DoS) from crashing the service.

==== Potential false positives

Environments that leverage DNS responses over 60k bytes will result in false positives - if this traffic is predictable and expected, it should be filtered out. Additionally, this detection rule could be triggered by an authorized vulnerability scan or compromise assessment.

==== Investigation guide

Detection alerts from this rule indicate an attempt was made to exploit
CVE-2020-1350 (SigRed) through the use of large DNS responses on a Windows DNS
server. Here are some possible avenues of investigation:

* Investigate any corresponding Intrusion Detection Signatures (IDS) alerts that can validate this detection alert.
* Examine the `dns.question_type` network fieldset with a protocol analyzer, such as Zeek, Packetbeat, or Suricata, for `SIG` or `RRSIG` data.
* Validate the patch level and OS of the targeted DNS server to validate the observed activity was not large-scale Internet vulnerability scanning.
* Validate that the source of the network activity was not from an authorized vulnerability scan or compromise assessment.
