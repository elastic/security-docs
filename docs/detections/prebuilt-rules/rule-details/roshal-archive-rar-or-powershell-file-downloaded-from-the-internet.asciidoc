=== Roshal Archive (RAR) or PowerShell File Downloaded from the Internet

Detects a Roshal Archive (RAR) file or PowerShell script downloaded from the internet by an internal host. Gaining initial access to a system and then downloading encoded or encrypted tools to move laterally is a common practice for adversaries as a way to protect their more valuable tools and TTPs. This may be atypical behavior for a managed network and can be indicative of malware, exfiltration, or command and control.
