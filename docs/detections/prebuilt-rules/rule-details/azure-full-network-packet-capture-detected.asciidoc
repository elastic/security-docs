==== Potential false positives

Full Network Packet Capture may be done by a system or network administrator. Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment. Full Network Packet Capture from unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.
