=== Public IP Reconnaissance Activity

Identifies domains commonly used by adversaries for post-exploitation IP reconnaissance. It is common for adversaries to test for Internet access and acquire their public IP address after they have gained access to a system. Among others, this has been observed in campaigns leveraging the information stealer, Trickbot.

==== Potential false positives

If the domains listed in this rule are used as part of an authorized workflow, this rule will be triggered by those events. Validate that this is expected activity and tune the rule to fit your environment variables.

==== Investigation guide

This rule takes HTTP redirects and HTTP referrer's into account, however neither HTTP redirect status codes nor HTTP referrer's are visible with TLS traffic which can lead to multiple events per alert.
