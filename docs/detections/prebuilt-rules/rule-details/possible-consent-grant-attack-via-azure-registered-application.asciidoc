==== Investigation guide


[source,markdown]
----------------------------------
## Triage and analysis

- In a consent grant attack, an attacker tricks an end user into granting a malicious application consent to access their data, usually via a phishing attack. After the malicious application has been granted consent, it has account-level access to data without the need for an organizational account.
- Normal remediation steps, like resetting passwords for breached accounts or requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on accounts, are not effective against this type of attack, since these are third-party applications and are external to the organization.
- Security analysts should review the list of trusted applications for any suspicious items.


## Config

The Azure Fleet integration, Filebeat module, or similarly structured data is required to be compatible with this rule.
