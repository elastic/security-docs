==== Potential false positives

A group may be created by a system or network administrator. Verify whether the
user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes in your
environment. Group creations from unfamiliar users or hosts should be
investigated. If a known behavior is causing false positives, it can be
excluded from the rule.
