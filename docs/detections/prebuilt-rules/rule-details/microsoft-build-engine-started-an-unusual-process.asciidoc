=== Microsoft Build Engine Started an Unusual Process

An instance of MSBuild, the Microsoft Build Engine, started a PowerShell script or the Visual C# Command Line Compiler. This technique is sometimes used to deploy a malicious payload using the Build Engine.

==== Potential false positives

The Build Engine is commonly used by Windows developers but use by non-engineers is unusual. If a build system triggers this rule it can be exempted by process, user or host name.

==== Investigation guide


[source,markdown]
----------------------------------
## Config

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

----------------------------------


==== Rule query


[source,js]
----------------------------------
process where event.type in ("start", "process_started") and
process.parent.name : "MSBuild.exe" and process.name : ("csc.exe",
"iexplore.exe", "powershell.exe")
----------------------------------
