==== Potential false positives

Privileged IAM users with security responsibilities may be expected to make changes to the Config service in order to align with local security policies and requirements. Automation, orchestration, and security tools may also make changes to the Config service, where they are used to automate setup or configuration of AWS accounts. Other kinds of user or service contexts do not commonly make changes to this service.
