==== Potential false positives

Privileged IAM users with security responsibilities may make changes to the
Config rules in order to align with local security policies and
requirements. Automation, orchestration, and security tools may also make
changes to the Config service, when they are used to automate setup or
configuration of AWS accounts. Other types of user or service contexts do not
commonly make changes to this service.

==== Investigation guide

The AWS Filebeat module must be enabled to use this rule.
