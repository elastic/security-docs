=== Linux Restricted Shell Breakout via the SSH command

Identifies Linux binary SSH abuse to break out from restricted environments by spawning an interactive system shell. The SSH protocol is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, a secure way to access a computer over a network. The activity of spawning shell is not a standard use of this binary for a user or system administrator. It indicates a potentially malicious actor attempting to improve the capabilities or stability of their access.
