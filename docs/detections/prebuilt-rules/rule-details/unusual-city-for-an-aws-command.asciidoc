=== Unusual City For an AWS Command

A machine learning job detected AWS command activity that, while not inherently
suspicious or abnormal, is sourcing from a geolocation (city) that is unusual
for the command. This can be the result of compromised credentials or keys
being used by a threat actor in a different location from the authorized users.

==== Potential false positives

New or unusual command and user geolocation activity can be due to manual
troubleshooting or reconfiguration, changes in cloud automation scripts or
workflows, adoption of new services, expansion into new regions, increased
adoption of work from home policies, or users who travel frequently.

==== Investigation guide

Alerts from this rule indicate an AWS API command or method call that is rare
and unusual for the geolocation of the source IP address. Here are some
possible avenues of investigation:

* Consider the source IP address and geolocation for the calling user who
issued the command. Do they look normal for the calling user? If the source is
an EC2 IP address, is it associated with an EC2 instance in one of your
accounts or could it be sourcing from an EC2 instance not under your control?
If it is an authorized EC2 instance, is the activity associated with normal
behavior for the instance role or roles? Are there any other alerts or signs of
suspicious activity involving this instance?
* Consider the user as identified by the `user.name` field. Is this command
part of an expected workflow for the user context? Examine the user identity in
the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` field and the access key id in the
`aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` field, which can help identify the
precise user context. The user agent details in the `user_agent.original` field
may also indicate what type of client made the request.
* Consider the time of day. If the user is a human, not a program or script,
did the activity take place during normal working hours?
* Examine the history of the command. If the command, which is visible in the
`event.action` field, manifested only very recently, it might be part of a new
automation module or script. If its usage rate is consistent - for example, if
it appears in small numbers on a weekly or monthly basis - it might be part of
a housekeeping or maintenance process.
* Examine the request parameters. These may provide indications as to the
source of the program or the nature of the tasks it is performing.
