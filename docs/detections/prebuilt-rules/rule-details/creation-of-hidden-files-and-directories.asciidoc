=== Creation of Hidden Files and Directories

Users can mark specific files as hidden simply by adding a `.` as the first
character in the file or folder name. Adversaries can use this to their
advantage to hide files and folders on the system for persistence and defense
evasion. This rule looks for hidden files or folders in common writable
directories.

==== Potential false positives

Certain tools may create hidden temporary files or directories upon
installation or as part of their normal behavior. These events can be filtered
by the process arguments, username, or process name values.

==== Rule query


[source,js]
----------------------------------
event.category:process AND event.type:(start or process_started) AND
process.working_directory:("/tmp" or "/var/tmp" or "/dev/shm") AND
process.args:/\.[a-zA-Z0-9_\-][a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]{1,254}/ AND NOT
process.name:(ls or find)
