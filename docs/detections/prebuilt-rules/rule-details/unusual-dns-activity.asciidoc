=== Unusual DNS Activity

A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual DNS query that indicates
network activity with unusual DNS domains. This can be due to initial access,
persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, when a
user clicks on a link in a phishing email or opens a malicious document, a
request may be sent to download and run a payload from an uncommon domain. When
malware is already running, it may send requests to an uncommon DNS domain the
malware uses for command-and-control communication.

==== Potential false positives

A newly installed program or one that runs rarely as part of a monthly or quarterly workflow could trigger this alert. Network activity that occurs rarely, in small quantities, can trigger this alert. Possible examples are browsing technical support or vendor networks sparsely. A user who visits a new or unique web destination may trigger this alert.
