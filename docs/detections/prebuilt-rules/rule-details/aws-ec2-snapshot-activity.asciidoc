=== AWS EC2 Snapshot Activity

An attempt was made to modify AWS EC2 snapshot attributes. Snapshots are
sometimes shared by threat actors in order to exfiltrate bulk data from an EC2
fleet. If the permissions were modified, verify the snapshot was not shared
with an unauthorized or unexpected AWS account.

belonging to the same organization. If a known behavior is causing false
positives, it can be excluded from the rule.
