=== AWS EC2 Snapshot Activity

An attempt was made to modify AWS EC2 snapshot attributes. Snapshots are
sometimes shared by threat actors in order to exfiltrate bulk data from an EC2
fleet. If the permissions were modified, verify the snapshot was not shared
with an unauthorized or unexpected AWS account.

==== Potential false positives

IAM users may occasionally share EC2 snapshots with another AWS account
belonging to the same organization. If a known behavior is causing false
positives, it can be excluded from the rule.

==== Investigation guide

The AWS Filebeat module must be enabled to use this rule.
