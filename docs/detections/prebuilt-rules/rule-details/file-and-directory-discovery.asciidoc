==== Potential false positives

Enumeration of files and directories may not be inherently malicious and noise may come from scripts, automation tools, or normal command line usage. It's important to baseline your environment to determine the amount of expected noise and exclude any known FP's from the rule.

==== Rule query


[source,js]
----------------------------------
sequence by agent.id, user.name with maxspan=1m [process where
event.type in ("start", "process_started") and ((process.name :
"cmd.exe" or process.pe.original_file_name == "Cmd.Exe") and
process.args : "dir") or process.name : "tree.com"] [process where
event.type in ("start", "process_started") and ((process.name :
"cmd.exe" or process.pe.original_file_name == "Cmd.Exe") and
process.args : "dir") or process.name : "tree.com"] [process where
event.type in ("start", "process_started") and ((process.name :
"cmd.exe" or process.pe.original_file_name == "Cmd.Exe") and
process.args : "dir") or process.name : "tree.com"]
