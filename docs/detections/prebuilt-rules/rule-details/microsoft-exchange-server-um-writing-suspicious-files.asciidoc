==== Investigation guide



*Triage and analysis*


Positive hits can be checked against the established Microsoft https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/tree/main/Security/Baselines[baselines].

Microsoft highly recommends that the best course of action is patching, but this may not protect already compromised systems
from existing intrusions. Other tools for detecting and mitigating can be found within their Exchange support
https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/tree/main/Security[repository]


==== Setup



*Setup*


If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2,
events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until version 8.2.
Hence for this rule to work effectively, users will need to add a custom ingest pipeline to populate
`event.ingested` to @timestamp.
For more details on adding a custom ingest pipeline refer - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/data-streams-pipeline-tutorial.html
