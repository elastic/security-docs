==== Potential false positives

Files generated during installation will generate a lot of noise, so the rule should only be enabled after the fact.
This rule was tuned using the following baseline: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/main/Security/Baselines/baseline_15.2.792.5.csv from Microsoft. Depending on version, consult https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/tree/main/Security/Baselines to help determine normalcy.

==== Investigation guide

*Triage and analysis*

Positive hits can be checked against the established Microsoft [baselines](https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/tree/main/Security/Baselines).

Microsoft highly recommends that the best course of action is patching, but this may not protect already compromised systems
from existing intrusions. Other tools for detecting and mitigating can be found within their Exchange support
