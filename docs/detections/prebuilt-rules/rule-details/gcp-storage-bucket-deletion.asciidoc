==== Potential false positives

Storage buckets may be deleted by a system or network administrator. Verify whether the user email, resource name, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment. Bucket deletions from unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.

==== Investigation guide

The GCP Filebeat module must be enabled to use this rule.
