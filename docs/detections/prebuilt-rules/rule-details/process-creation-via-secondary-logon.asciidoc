Identifies process creation with alternate credentials. Adversaries may create a new process with a different token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls.

==== Setup



*Setup*


Audit events 4624 and 4688 are needed to trigger this rule.

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2,
events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until version 8.2.
Hence for this rule to work effectively, users will need to add a custom ingest pipeline to populate
`event.ingested` to @timestamp.
For more details on adding a custom ingest pipeline refer - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/data-streams-pipeline-tutorial.html


==== Rule query


[source, js]
----------------------------------
sequence by winlog.computer_name with maxspan=1m

[authentication where event.action:"logged-in" and
 event.outcome == "success" and user.id : ("S-1-5-21-*", "S-1-12-1-*") and

 /* seclogon service */
 process.name == "svchost.exe" and
 winlog.event_data.LogonProcessName : "seclogo*" and source.ip == "::1" ] by winlog.event_data.TargetLogonId

[process where event.type == "start"] by winlog.event_data.TargetLogonId
