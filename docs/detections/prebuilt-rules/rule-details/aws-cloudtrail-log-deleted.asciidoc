==== Potential false positives

Trail deletions may be made by a system or network administrator. Verify
whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes
in your environment. Trail deletions from unfamiliar users or hosts should be
investigated. If a known behavior is causing false positives, it can be
excluded from the rule.

==== Investigation guide

The AWS Filebeat module must be enabled to use this rule.
