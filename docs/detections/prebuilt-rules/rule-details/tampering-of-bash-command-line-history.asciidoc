==== Investigation guide


[source,markdown]
----------------------------------
## Config

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

----------------------------------


==== Rule query


[source,js]
----------------------------------
process where event.type in ("start", "process_started") and (
(process.args : ("rm", "echo") and process.args : (".bash_history",
"/root/.bash_history", "/home/*/.bash_history")) or (process.name :
"history" and process.args : "-c") or (process.args : "export" and
process.args : ("HISTFILE=/dev/null", "HISTFILESIZE=0")) or
(process.args : "unset" and process.args : "HISTFILE") or
(process.args : "set" and process.args : "history" and process.args :
"+o") )
