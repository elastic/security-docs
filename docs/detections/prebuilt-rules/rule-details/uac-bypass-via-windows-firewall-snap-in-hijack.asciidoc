=== UAC Bypass via Windows Firewall Snap-In Hijack

Identifies attempts to bypass User Account Control (UAC) by hijacking the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Windows Firewall snap-in. Attackers bypass UAC to stealthily execute code with elevated permissions.

==== Investigation guide


[source,markdown]
----------------------------------
## Config

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

----------------------------------


==== Rule query


[source,js]
----------------------------------
process where event.type in ("start", "process_started") and
process.parent.name == "mmc.exe" and /*
process.Ext.token.integrity_level_name == "high" can be added in
future for tuning */ /* args of the Windows Firewall SnapIn */
process.parent.args == "WF.msc" and process.name != "WerFault.exe"
----------------------------------
