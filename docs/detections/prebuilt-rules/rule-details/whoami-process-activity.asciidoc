==== Potential false positives

Some normal use of this program, at varying levels of frequency, may originate from scripts, automation tools and frameworks. Usage by non-engineers and ordinary users is unusual.

==== Investigation guide


[source,markdown]
----------------------------------
## Config

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

----------------------------------


==== Rule query


[source,js]
----------------------------------
process where event.type in ("start", "process_started") and
process.name : "whoami.exe"
