=== Timestomping using Touch Command

Timestomping is an anti-forensics technique which is used to modify the timestamps of a file, often to mimic files that are in the same folder.

==== Investigation guide


[source,markdown]
----------------------------------
## Config

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

----------------------------------


==== Rule query


[source,js]
----------------------------------
process where event.type == "start" and process.name : "touch" and
user.id != "0" and process.args : ("-r", "-t", "-a*","-m*") and not
process.args : ("/usr/lib/go-*/bin/go", "/usr/lib/dracut/dracut-
functions.sh", "/tmp/KSInstallAction.*/m/.patch/*")
