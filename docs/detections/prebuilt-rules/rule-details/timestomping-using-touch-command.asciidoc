=== Timestomping using Touch Command

Timestomping is an anti-forensics technique which is used to modify the timestamps of a file, often to mimic files that are in the same folder.

==== Setup



*Setup*


If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2,
events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until version 8.2.
Hence for this rule to work effectively, users will need to add a custom ingest pipeline to populate
`event.ingested` to @timestamp.
For more details on adding a custom ingest pipeline refer - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/data-streams-pipeline-tutorial.html


==== Rule query


[source, js]
----------------------------------
process where event.type == "start" and
 process.name : "touch" and user.id != "0" and
 process.args : ("-r", "-t", "-a*","-m*") and
 not process.args : (
   "/usr/lib/go-*/bin/go", "/usr/lib/dracut/dracut-functions.sh", "/tmp/KSInstallAction.*/m/.patch/*"
) and not process.parent.name in ("pmlogger_daily", "pmlogger_janitor", "systemd")
