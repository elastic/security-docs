[[aws-rds-db-snapshot-created]]
=== AWS RDS DB Snapshot Created

Identifies when an AWS RDS DB Snapshot is created. This can be used to evade defenses by allowing an attacker to bypass access controls or cover their tracks by reverting an instance to a previous state. This is a [building block rule](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/building-block-rule.html) and does not generate alerts on its own. It is meant to be used for correlation with other rules to detect suspicious activity. To generate alerts, create a rule that uses this signal as a building block.
