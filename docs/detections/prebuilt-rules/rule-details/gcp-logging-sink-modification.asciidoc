=== GCP Logging Sink Modification

Identifies a modification to a Logging sink in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Logging compares the log entry to the sinks in that resource. Each sink whose filter matches the log entry writes a copy of the log entry to the sink's export destination. An adversary may update a Logging sink to exfiltrate logs to a different export destination.

==== Potential false positives

Logging sink modifications may be done by a system or network administrator. Verify whether the user email, resource name, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment. Sink modifications from unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.

==== Investigation guide

The GCP Filebeat module must be enabled to use this rule.
