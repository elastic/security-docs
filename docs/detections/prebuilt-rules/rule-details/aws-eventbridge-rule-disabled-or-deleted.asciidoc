==== Potential false positives

EventBridge Rules could be deleted or disabled by a system administrator. Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment. EventBridge Rules being deleted or disabled by unfamiliar users should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.
