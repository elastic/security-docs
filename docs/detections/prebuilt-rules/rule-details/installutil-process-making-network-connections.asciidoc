==== Rule query


[source,js]
----------------------------------
/* the benefit of doing this as an eql sequence vs kql is this will
limit to alerting only on the first network connection */ sequence by
process.entity_id [process where event.type in ("start",
"process_started") and process.name : "installutil.exe"] [network
where process.name : "installutil.exe" and network.direction ==
"outgoing"]
