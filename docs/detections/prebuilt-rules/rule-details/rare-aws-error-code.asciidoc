=== Rare AWS Error Code

A machine learning job detected an unusual error in a CloudTrail message. These
can be byproducts of attempted or successful persistence, privilege escalation,
defense evasion, discovery, lateral movement, or collection.

==== Potential false positives

Rare and unusual errors may indicate an impending service failure state. Rare
and unusual user error activity can also be due to manual troubleshooting or
reconfiguration attempts by insufficiently privileged users, bugs in cloud
automation scripts or workflows, or changes to IAM privileges.

==== Investigation guide

Alerts from this rule indicate a rare and unusual error code that is
associated with the response to an AWS API command or method call. Here are
some possible avenues of investigation:

* Examine the history of the error. Has it manifested before? If the error,
which is visible in the `aws.cloudtrail.error_code field`, manifested only very
recently, it might be related to recent changes in an automation module or
script.
* Examine the request parameters. These may provide indications as to the
nature of the task being performed when the error occurred. Is the error
related to unsuccessful attempts to enumerate or access objects, data, or
secrets? If so, this can sometimes be a byproduct of discovery, privilege
escalation, or lateral movement attempts.
* Consider the user as identified in the `user.name` field. Is this activity
part of an expected workflow for the user context? Examine the user identity in
the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` field and the access key id in the
`aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` field, which can help identify the
precise user context. The user agent details in the `user_agent.original` field
may also indicate what type of client made the request.
* Consider the source IP address and geolocation for the calling user who
issued the command. Do they look normal for the calling user? If the source is
an EC2 IP address, is it associated with an EC2 instance in one of your
accounts or could it be sourcing from an EC2 instance not under your control?
If it is an authorized EC2 instance, is the activity associated with normal
behavior for the instance role or roles? Are there any other alerts or signs of
suspicious activity involving this instance?
