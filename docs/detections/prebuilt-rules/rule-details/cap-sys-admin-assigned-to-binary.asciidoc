=== CAP_SYS_ADMIN Assigned to Binary

Identifies instances where a binary is granted the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability. In Linux, the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability is a powerful and broad capability that allows a process to perform a range of system administration operations, such as mounting and unmounting filesystems, configuring network interfaces, and accessing hardware devices. Attackers may leverage a misconfiguration for exploitation in order to escalate their privileges to root. The rule identifies previously unknown processes executing with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities through the use of the new terms rule type.
