=== Whitespace Padding in Process Command Line

Identifies process execution events where the command line value contains a long sequence of whitespace characters or multiple occurrences of contiguous whitespace. Attackers may attempt to evade signature-based detections by padding their malicious command with unnecessary whitespace characters. These observations should be investigated for malicious behavior.

==== Investigation guide


[source,markdown]
----------------------------------
## Triage and analysis

- Analyze the command line of the process in question for evidence of malicious code execution.
- Review the ancestor and child processes spawned by the process in question for indicators of further malicious code execution.
----------------------------------


==== Rule query


[source,js]
----------------------------------
process where event.type in ("start", "process_started") and
process.command_line regex ".*[ ]{20,}.*" or /* this will match
on 3 or more separate occurrences of 5+ contiguous whitespace
characters */ process.command_line regex ".*(.*[ ]{5,}[^ ]*){3,}.*"
----------------------------------
