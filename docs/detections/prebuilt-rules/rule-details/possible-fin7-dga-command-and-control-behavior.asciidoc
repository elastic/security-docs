=== Possible FIN7 DGA Command and Control Behavior

This rule detects a known command and control pattern in network events. The FIN7 threat group is known to use this command and control technique, while maintaining persistence in their target's network.

==== Potential false positives

This rule could identify benign domains that are formatted similarly to FIN7's command and control algorithm. Alerts should be investigated by an analyst to assess the validity of the individual observations.

==== Investigation guide

In the event this rule identifies benign domains in your environment, the `destination.domain` field in the rule can be modified to include those domains. Example: `...AND NOT destination.domain:(zoom.us OR benign.domain1 OR benign.domain2)`.

==== Rule query
