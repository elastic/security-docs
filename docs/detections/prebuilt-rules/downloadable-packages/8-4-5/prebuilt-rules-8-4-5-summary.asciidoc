[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
|Rule |Description |Status |Version

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-4-5-first-time-seen-google-workspace-oauth-login-from-third-party-application, First Time Seen Google Workspace OAuth Login from Third-Party Application>> | Detects the first time a third-party application logs in and authenticated with OAuth. OAuth is used to grant permissions to specific resources and services in Google Workspace. Compromised credentials or service accounts could allow an adversary to authenticate to Google Workspace as a valid user and inherit their privileges. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-4-5-potential-hidden-process-via-mount-hidepid, Potential Hidden Process via Mount Hidepid>> | Identifies the execution of mount process with hidepid parameter, which can make processes invisible to other users from the system. Adversaries using Linux kernel version 3.2+ (or RHEL/CentOS v6.5+ above) can hide the process from other users. When hidepid=2 option is executed to mount the /proc filesystem, only the root user can see all processes and the logged-in user can only see their own process. This provides a defense evasion mechanism for the adversaries to hide their process executions from all other commands such as ps, top, pgrep and more. With the Linux kernel hardening hidepid option all the user has to do is remount the /proc filesystem with the option, which can now be monitored and detected. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-4-5-potential-defense-evasion-via-proot, Potential Defense Evasion via PRoot>> | Identifies the execution of the PRoot utility, an open-source tool for user-space implementation of chroot, mount --bind, and binfmt_misc. Adversaries can leverage an open-source tool PRoot to expand the scope of their operations to multiple Linux distributions and simplify their necessary efforts. In a normal threat scenario, the scope of an attack is limited by the varying configurations of each Linux distribution. With PRoot, it provides an attacker with a consistent operational environment across different Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and Alpine. PRoot also provides emulation capabilities that allow for malware built on other architectures, such as ARM, to be run.The post-exploitation technique called bring your own filesystem (BYOF), can be used by the threat actors to execute malicious payload or elevate privileges or perform network scans or orchestrate another attack on the environment. Although PRoot was originally not developed with malicious intent it can be easily tuned to work for one. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-4-5-google-workspace-object-copied-from-external-drive-and-access-granted-to-custom-application, Google Workspace Object Copied from External Drive and Access Granted to Custom Application>> | Detects when a user copies a Google spreadsheet, form, document or script from an external drive. Sequence logic has been added to also detect when a user grants a custom Google application permission via OAuth shortly after. An adversary may send a phishing email to the victim with a Drive object link where "copy" is included in the URI, thus copying the object to the victim's drive. If a container-bound script exists within the object, execution will require permission access via OAuth in which the user has to accept. | update | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-4-5-potential-linux-credential-dumping-via-unshadow, Potential Linux Credential Dumping via Unshadow>> | Identifies the execution of the unshadow utility which is part of John the Ripper, a password-cracking tool on the host machine. Malicious actors can use the utility to retrieve the combined contents of the '/etc/shadow' and '/etc/password' files. Using the combined file generated from the utility, the malicious threat actors can use them as input for password-cracking utilities or prepare themselves for future operations by gathering credential information of the victim. | update | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-4-5-linux-restricted-shell-breakout-via-linux-binary-s, Linux Restricted Shell Breakout via Linux Binary(s)>> | Identifies Linux binary(s) abuse to breakout of restricted shells or environments by spawning an interactive system shell. The linux utility(s) activity of spawning shell is not a standard use of the binary for a user or system administrator. It may indicates an attempt to improve the capabilities or stability of an adversary access. | update | 104 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-4-5-unusual-linux-network-configuration-discovery, Unusual Linux Network Configuration Discovery>> | Looks for commands related to system network configuration discovery from an unusual user context. This can be due to uncommon troubleshooting activity or due to a compromised account. A compromised account may be used by a threat actor to engage in system network configuration discovery in order to increase their understanding of connected networks and hosts. This information may be used to shape follow-up behaviors such as lateral movement or additional discovery. | update | 102 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-4-5-unusual-linux-user-discovery-activity, Unusual Linux User Discovery Activity>> | Looks for commands related to system user or owner discovery from an unusual user context. This can be due to uncommon troubleshooting activity or due to a compromised account. A compromised account may be used to engage in system owner or user discovery in order to identify currently active or primary users of a system. This may be a precursor to additional discovery, credential dumping or privilege elevation activity. | update | 102 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-4-5-connection-to-commonly-abused-web-services, Connection to Commonly Abused Web Services>> | Adversaries may implement command and control (C2) communications that use common web services to hide their activity. This attack technique is typically targeted at an organization and uses web services common to the victim network, which allows the adversary to blend into legitimate traffic activity. These popular services are typically targeted since they have most likely been used before compromise, which helps malicious traffic blend in. | update | 105 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-4-5-multiple-logon-failure-from-the-same-source-address, Multiple Logon Failure from the same Source Address>> | Identifies multiple consecutive logon failures from the same source address and within a short time interval. Adversaries will often brute force login attempts across multiple users with a common or known password, in an attempt to gain access to accounts. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-4-5-potential-credential-access-via-windows-utilities, Potential Credential Access via Windows Utilities>> | Identifies the execution of known Windows utilities often abused to dump LSASS memory or the Active Directory database (NTDS.dit) in preparation for credential access. | update | 106 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-4-5-powershell-suspicious-payload-encoded-and-compressed, PowerShell Suspicious Payload Encoded and Compressed>> | Identifies the use of .NET functionality for decompression and base64 decoding combined in PowerShell scripts, which malware and security tools heavily use to deobfuscate payloads and load them directly in memory to bypass defenses. | update | 106 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-4-5-potential-process-injection-via-powershell, Potential Process Injection via PowerShell>> | Detects the use of Windows API functions that are commonly abused by malware and security tools to load malicious code or inject it into remote processes. | update | 106 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-4-5-powershell-suspicious-discovery-related-windows-api-functions, PowerShell Suspicious Discovery Related Windows API Functions>> | This rule detects the use of discovery-related Windows API functions in PowerShell Scripts. Attackers can use these functions to perform various situational awareness related activities, like enumerating users, shares, sessions, domain trusts, groups, etc. | update | 107 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-4-5-third-party-backup-files-deleted-via-unexpected-process, Third-party Backup Files Deleted via Unexpected Process>> | Identifies the deletion of backup files, saved using third-party software, by a process outside of the backup suite. Adversaries may delete Backup files to ensure that recovery from a ransomware attack is less likely. | update | 105 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-4-5-component-object-model-hijacking, Component Object Model Hijacking>> | Identifies Component Object Model (COM) hijacking via registry modification. Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to COM objects. | update | 105 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-4-5-powershell-script-with-token-impersonation-capabilities, PowerShell Script with Token Impersonation Capabilities>> | Detects scripts that contain PowerShell functions, structures, or Windows API functions related to token impersonation/theft. Attackers may duplicate then impersonate another user's token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. | update | 5
