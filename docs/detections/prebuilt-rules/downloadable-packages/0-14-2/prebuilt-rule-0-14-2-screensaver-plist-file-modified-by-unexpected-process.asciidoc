=== Screensaver Plist File Modified by Unexpected Process

Identifies when a screensaver plist file is modified by an unexpected process. An adversary can maintain persistence on a macOS endpoint by creating a malicious screensaver (.saver) file and configuring the screensaver plist file to execute code each time the screensaver is activated.

==== Investigation guide


[source, markdown]
----------------------------------
## Triage and analysis

- Analyze the plist file modification event to identify whether the change was expected or not
- Investigate the process that modified the plist file for malicious code or other suspicious behavior
- Identify if any suspicious or known malicious screensaver (.saver) files were recently written to or modified on the host
----------------------------------

==== Rule query


[source, js]
----------------------------------
file where event.type != "deletion" and
  file.name: "com.apple.screensaver.*.plist" and
  file.path : (
    "/Users/*/Library/Preferences/ByHost/*",
    "/Library/Managed Preferences/*",
    "/System/Library/Preferences/*"
    ) and
  /* Filter OS processes modifying screensaver plist files */
  not process.executable : (
