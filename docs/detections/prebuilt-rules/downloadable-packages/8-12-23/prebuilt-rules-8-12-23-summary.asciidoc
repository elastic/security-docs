|<<prebuilt-rule-8-12-23-message-of-the-day-motd-file-creation, Message-of-the-Day (MOTD) File Creation>> | This rule detects the creation of potentially malicious files within the default MOTD file directories. Message of the day (MOTD) is the message that is presented to the user when a user connects to a Linux server via SSH or a serial connection. Linux systems contain several default MOTD files located in the "/etc/update-motd.d/" directory. These scripts run as the root user every time a user connects over SSH or a serial connection. Adversaries may create malicious MOTD files that grant them persistence onto the target every time a user connects to the system by executing a backdoor script or command. | update | 12 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-12-23-executable-bit-set-for-potential-persistence-script, Executable Bit Set for Potential Persistence Script>> | This rule monitors for the addition of an executable bit for scripts that are located in directories which are commonly abused for persistence. An alert of this rule is an indicator that a persistence mechanism is being set up within your environment. Adversaries may create these scripts to execute malicious code at start-up, or at a set interval to gain persistence onto the system. | update | 4 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-12-23-suspicious-rc-local-error-message, Suspicious rc.local Error Message>> | This rule monitors the syslog log file for error messages related to the rc.local process. The rc.local file is a script that is executed during the boot process on Linux systems. Attackers may attempt to modify the rc.local file to execute malicious commands or scripts during system startup. This rule detects error messages such as "Connection refused," "No such file or directory," or "command not found" in the syslog log file, which may indicate that the rc.local file has been tampered with. | update | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-12-23-potential-execution-of-rc-local-script, Potential Execution of rc.local Script>> | This rule detects the potential execution of the `/etc/rc.local` script through the `already_running` event action created by the `rc-local.service` systemd service. The `/etc/rc.local` script is a legacy initialization script that is executed at the end of the boot process. The `/etc/rc.local` script is not enabled by default on most Linux distributions. The `/etc/rc.local` script can be used by attackers to persistently execute malicious commands or scripts on a compromised system at reboot. As the rc.local file is executed prior to the initialization of Elastic Defend, the execution event is not ingested, and therefore the `already_running` event is leveraged to provide insight into the potential execution of `rc.local`. | update | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-12-23-rc-local-rc-common-file-creation, rc.local/rc.common File Creation>> | This rule monitors the creation/alteration of the rc.local/rc.common file. The /etc/rc.local file is used to start custom applications, services, scripts or commands during start-up. The rc.local file has mostly been replaced by Systemd.
