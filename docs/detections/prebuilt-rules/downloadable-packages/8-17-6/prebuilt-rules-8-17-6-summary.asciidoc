[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
|Rule |Description |Status |Version

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-6-suspicious-interactive-shell-spawned-from-inside-a-container, Suspicious Interactive Shell Spawned From Inside A Container>> | This rule detects when an interactive shell is spawned inside a running container. This could indicate a potential container breakout attempt or an attacker's attempt to gain unauthorized access to the underlying host. | update | 4 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-6-ssh-process-launched-from-inside-a-container, SSH Process Launched From Inside A Container>> | This rule detects an SSH or SSHD process executed from inside a container. This includes both the client ssh binary and server ssh daemon process. SSH usage inside a container should be avoided and monitored closely when necessary. With valid credentials an attacker may move laterally to other containers or to the underlying host through container breakout. They may also use valid SSH credentials as a persistence mechanism. | update | 4 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-6-bpf-filter-applied-using-tc, BPF filter applied using TC>> | Detects when the tc (transmission control) binary is utilized to set a BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) on a network interface. Tc is used to configure Traffic Control in the Linux kernel. It can shape, schedule, police and drop traffic. A threat actor can utilize tc to set a bpf filter on an interface for the purpose of manipulating the incoming traffic. This technique is not at all common and should indicate abnormal, suspicious or malicious activity. | update | 211 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-6-apple-script-execution-followed-by-network-connection, Apple Script Execution followed by Network Connection>> | Detects execution via the Apple script interpreter (osascript) followed by a network connection from the same process within a short time period. Adversaries may use malicious scripts for execution and command and control. | update | 109 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-6-suspicious-inter-process-communication-via-outlook, Suspicious Inter-Process Communication via Outlook>> | Detects Inter-Process Communication with Outlook via Component Object Model from an unusual process. Adversaries may target user email to collect sensitive information or send email on their behalf via API. | update | 9 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-6-potential-relay-attack-against-a-domain-controller, Potential Relay Attack against a Domain Controller>> | Identifies potential relay attacks against a domain controller (DC) by identifying authentication events using the domain controller computer account coming from other hosts to the DC that owns the account. Attackers may relay the DC hash after capturing it using forced authentication. | update | 104 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-6-untrusted-dll-loaded-by-azure-ad-sync-service, Untrusted DLL Loaded by Azure AD Sync Service>> | Identifies the load of a DLL without a valid code signature by the Azure AD Sync process, which may indicate an attempt to persist or collect sensitive credentials passing through the Azure AD synchronization server. | update | 103 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-6-sensitive-registry-hive-access-via-regback, Sensitive Registry Hive Access via RegBack>> | Identifies attempts to access sensitive registry hives which contain credentials from the registry backup folder. | update | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-6-sensitive-audit-policy-sub-category-disabled, Sensitive Audit Policy Sub-Category Disabled>> | Identifies attempts to disable auditing for some security sensitive audit policy sub-categories. This is often done by attackers in an attempt to evade detection and forensics on a system. | update | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-6-execution-via-windows-command-debugging-utility, Execution via Windows Command Debugging Utility>> | An adversary can use the Windows command line debugging utility cdb.exe to execute commands or shellcode. This rule looks for those instances and where the cdb.exe binary is outside of the normal WindowsKit installation paths. | update | 104 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-6-potential-evasion-via-windows-filtering-platform, Potential Evasion via Windows Filtering Platform>> | Identifies multiple Windows Filtering Platform block events and where the process name is related to an endpoint security software. Adversaries may add malicious WFP rules to prevent Endpoint security from sending telemetry. | update | 106 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-6-mofcomp-activity, Mofcomp Activity>> | Managed Object Format (MOF) files can be compiled locally or remotely through mofcomp.exe. Attackers may leverage MOF files to build their own namespaces and classes into the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) repository, or establish persistence using WMI Event Subscription. | update | 6 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-6-execution-of-a-downloaded-windows-script, Execution of a Downloaded Windows Script>> | Identifies the creation of a Windows script downloaded from the internet followed by the execution of a scripting utility. Adversaries may use Windows script files for initial access and execution. | update | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-6-suspicious-file-renamed-via-smb, Suspicious File Renamed via SMB>> | Identifies an incoming SMB connection followed by a suspicious file rename operation. This may indicate a remote ransomware attack via the SMB protocol. | update | 4 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-6-potential-ransomware-note-file-dropped-via-smb, Potential Ransomware Note File Dropped via SMB>> | Identifies an incoming SMB connection followed by the creation of a file with a name similar to ransomware note files. This may indicate a remote ransomware attack via the SMB protocol. | update | 4 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-6-potential-wsus-abuse-for-lateral-movement, Potential WSUS Abuse for Lateral Movement>> | Identifies a potential Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) abuse to execute psexec to enable for lateral movement. WSUS is limited to executing Microsoft signed binaries, which limits the executables that can be used to tools published by Microsoft. | update | 207 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-6-account-configured-with-never-expiring-password, Account Configured with Never-Expiring Password>> | Detects the creation and modification of an account with the "Don't Expire Password" option Enabled. Attackers can abuse this misconfiguration to persist in the domain and maintain long-term access using compromised accounts with this property. | update | 213 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-6-local-scheduled-task-creation, Local Scheduled Task Creation>> | Indicates the creation of a scheduled task. Adversaries can use these to establish persistence, move laterally, and/or escalate privileges. | update | 210 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-6-suspicious-dll-loaded-for-persistence-or-privilege-escalation, Suspicious DLL Loaded for Persistence or Privilege Escalation>> | Identifies the loading of a non Microsoft signed DLL that is missing on a default Windows install (phantom DLL) or one that can be loaded from a different location by a native Windows process. This may be abused to persist or elevate privileges via privileged file write vulnerabilities. | update | 214 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-6-potential-exploitation-of-an-unquoted-service-path-vulnerability, Potential Exploitation of an Unquoted Service Path Vulnerability>> | Adversaries may leverage unquoted service path vulnerabilities to escalate privileges. By placing an executable in a higher-level directory within the path of an unquoted service executable, Windows will natively launch this executable from its defined path variable instead of the benign one in a deeper directory, thus leading to code execution. | update | 205
