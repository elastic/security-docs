=== Privilege Escalation via Rogue Named Pipe Impersonation

Identifies a privilege escalation attempt via rogue named pipe impersonation. An adversary may abuse this technique by masquerading as a known named pipe and manipulating a privileged process to connect to it.

==== Investigation guide


[source, markdown]
----------------------------------
Named Pipe Creation Events need to be enabled within the Sysmon configuration by including the following settings:
`condition equal "contains" and keyword equal "pipe"`

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.
----------------------------------

==== Rule query


[source, js]
----------------------------------
file where event.action : "Pipe Created*" and
 /* normal sysmon named pipe creation events truncate the pipe keyword */
  file.name : "\\*\\Pipe\\*"
