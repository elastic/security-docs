|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-1-high-mean-of-process-arguments-in-an-rdp-session, High Mean of Process Arguments in an RDP Session>> | A machine learning job has detected unusually high number of process arguments in an RDP session. Executing sophisticated attacks such as lateral movement can involve the use of complex commands, obfuscation mechanisms, redirection and piping, which in turn increases the number of arguments in a command. | new | 1

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-1-high-mean-of-rdp-session-duration, High Mean of RDP Session Duration>> | A machine learning job has detected unusually high mean of RDP session duration. Long RDP sessions can be used to evade detection mechanisms via session persistence, and might be used to perform tasks such as lateral movement, that might require uninterrupted access to a compromised machine. | new | 1

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-1-unusual-remote-file-size, Unusual Remote File Size>> | A machine learning job has detected an unusually high file size shared by a remote host indicating potential lateral movement activity. One of the primary goals of attackers after gaining access to a network is to locate and exfiltrate valuable information. Instead of multiple small transfers that can raise alarms, attackers might choose to bundle data into a single large file transfer. | new | 1

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-1-high-variance-in-rdp-session-duration, High Variance in RDP Session Duration>> | A machine learning job has detected unusually high variance of RDP session duration. Long RDP sessions can be used to evade detection mechanisms via session persistence, and might be used to perform tasks such as lateral movement, that might require uninterrupted access to a compromised machine. | new | 1

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-1-unusual-remote-file-directory, Unusual Remote File Directory>> | An anomaly detection job has detected a remote file transfer on an unusual directory indicating a potential lateral movement activity on the host. Many Security solutions monitor well-known directories for suspicious activities, so attackers might use less common directories to bypass monitoring. | new | 1

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-1-unusual-remote-file-extension, Unusual Remote File Extension>> | An anomaly detection job has detected a remote file transfer with a rare extension, which could indicate potential lateral movement activity on the host. | new | 1

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-1-potential-network-sweep-detected, Potential Network Sweep Detected>> | This rule identifies a potential network sweep.  A network sweep is a method used by attackers to scan a target network, identifying active hosts, open ports, and available services to gather information on vulnerabilities and weaknesses. This reconnaissance helps them plan subsequent attacks and exploit potential entry points for unauthorized access, data theft, or other malicious activities. This rule proposes threshold logic to check for connection attempts from one source host to 10 or more destination hosts on commonly used network services. | update | 3

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-1-potential-network-scan-detected, Potential Network Scan Detected>> | This rule identifies a potential port scan. A port scan is a method utilized by attackers to systematically scan a target system or network for open ports, allowing them to identify available services and potential vulnerabilities. By mapping out the open ports, attackers can gather critical information to plan and execute targeted attacks, gaining unauthorized access, compromising security, and potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized control, or further exploitation of the targeted system or network. This rule proposes threshold logic to check for connection attempts from one source host to 20 or more destination ports. | update | 3

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-1-potential-syn-based-network-scan-detected, Potential SYN-Based Network Scan Detected>> | This rule identifies a potential SYN-Based port scan. A SYN port scan is a technique employed by attackers to scan a target network for open ports by sending SYN packets to multiple ports and observing the response. Attackers use this method to identify potential entry points or services that may be vulnerable to exploitation, allowing them to launch targeted attacks or gain unauthorized access to the system or network, compromising its security and potentially leading to data breaches or further malicious activities. This rule proposes threshold logic to check for connection attempts from one source host to 10 or more destination ports using 2 or less packets per port. | update | 3

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-1-rpc-remote-procedure-call-from-the-internet, RPC (Remote Procedure Call) from the Internet>> | This rule detects network events that may indicate the use of RPC traffic from the Internet.
