If a container-bound script exists within the object, execution will require permission access via OAuth in which the user has to accept. | update | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-google-workspace-suspended-user-account-renewed, Google Workspace Suspended User Account Renewed>> | Detects when a previously suspended user's account is renewed in Google Workspace. An adversary may renew a suspended user account to maintain access to the Google Workspace organization with a valid account. | update | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-application-added-to-google-workspace-domain, Application Added to Google Workspace Domain>> | Detects when a Google marketplace application is added to the Google Workspace domain. An adversary may add a malicious application to an organization’s Google Workspace domain in order to maintain a presence in their target’s organization and steal data. | update | 205 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-google-workspace-2sv-policy-disabled, Google Workspace 2SV Policy Disabled>> | Google Workspace admins may setup 2-step verification (2SV) to add an extra layer of security to user accounts by asking users to verify their identity when they use login credentials. Admins have the ability to enforce 2SV from the admin console as well as the methods acceptable for verification and enrollment period. 2SV requires enablement on admin accounts prior to it being enabled for users within organization units. Adversaries may disable 2SV to lower the security requirements to access a valid account. | update | 106 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-google-workspace-admin-role-assigned-to-a-user, Google Workspace Admin Role Assigned to a User>> | Assigning the administrative role to a user will grant them access to the Google Admin console and grant them administrator privileges which allow them to access and manage various resources and applications. An adversary may create a new administrator account for persistence or apply the admin role to an existing user to carry out further intrusion efforts. Users with super-admin privileges can bypass single-sign on if enabled in Google Workspace. | update | 206 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-google-workspace-api-access-granted-via-domain-wide-delegation-of-authority, Google Workspace API Access Granted via Domain-Wide Delegation of Authority>> | Detects when a domain-wide delegation of authority is granted to a service account. Domain-wide delegation can be configured to grant third-party and internal applications to access the data of Google Workspace users. An adversary may configure domain-wide delegation to maintain access to their target’s data. | update | 205 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-google-workspace-custom-admin-role-created, Google Workspace Custom Admin Role Created>> | Detects when a custom admin role is created in Google Workspace. An adversary may create a custom admin role in order to elevate the permissions of other user accounts and persist in their target’s environment. | update | 205 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-google-workspace-password-policy-modified, Google Workspace Password Policy Modified>> | Detects when a Google Workspace password policy is modified. An adversary may attempt to modify a password policy in order to weaken an organization’s security controls. | update | 205 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-google-workspace-role-modified, Google Workspace Role Modified>> | Detects when a custom admin role or its permissions are modified.

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-google-workspace-user-organizational-unit-changed, Google Workspace User Organizational Unit Changed>> | Users in Google Workspace are typically assigned a specific organizational unit that grants them permissions to certain services and roles that are inherited from this organizational unit. Adversaries may compromise a valid account and change which organizational account the user belongs to which then could allow them to inherit permissions to applications and resources inaccessible prior to. | update | 106 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-mfa-disabled-for-google-workspace-organization, MFA Disabled for Google Workspace Organization>> | Detects when multi-factor authentication (MFA) is disabled for a Google Workspace organization. An adversary may attempt to modify a password policy in order to weaken an organization’s security controls. | update | 205 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-kubernetes-denied-service-account-request, Kubernetes Denied Service Account Request>> | This rule detects when a service account makes an unauthorized request for resources from the API server. Service accounts follow a very predictable pattern of behavior. A service account should never send an unauthorized request to the API server. This behavior is likely an indicator of compromise or of a problem within the cluster. An adversary may have gained access to credentials/tokens and this could be an attempt to access or create resources to facilitate further movement or execution within the cluster. | update | 4 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-kubernetes-suspicious-self-subject-review, Kubernetes Suspicious Self-Subject Review>> | This rule detects when a service account or node attempts to enumerate their own permissions via the selfsubjectaccessreview or selfsubjectrulesreview APIs. This is highly unusual behavior for non-human identities like service accounts and nodes. An adversary may have gained access to credentials/tokens and this could be an attempt to determine what privileges they have to facilitate further movement or execution within the cluster. | update | 202 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-kubernetes-user-exec-into-pod, Kubernetes User Exec into Pod>> | This rule detects a user attempt to establish a shell session into a pod using the 'exec' command. Using the 'exec' command in a pod allows a user to establish a temporary shell session and execute any process/commands in the pod. An adversary may call bash to gain a persistent interactive shell which will allow access to any data the pod has permissions to, including secrets. | update | 202 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-kubernetes-anonymous-request-authorized, Kubernetes Anonymous Request Authorized>> | This rule detects when an unauthenticated user request is authorized within the cluster. Attackers may attempt to use anonymous accounts to gain initial access to the cluster or to avoid attribution of their activities within the cluster. This rule excludes the /healthz, /livez and /readyz endpoints which are commonly accessed anonymously. | update | 4 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-kubernetes-exposed-service-created-with-type-nodeport, Kubernetes Exposed Service Created With Type NodePort>> | This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a service as type NodePort. The NodePort service allows a user to externally expose a set of labeled pods to the internet. This creates an open port on every worker node in the cluster that has a pod for that service. When external traffic is received on that open port, it directs it to the specific pod through the service representing it. A malicious user can configure a service as type Nodeport in order to intercept traffic from other pods or nodes, bypassing firewalls and other network security measures configured for load balancers within a cluster. This creates a direct method of communication between the cluster and the outside world, which could be used for more malicious behavior and certainly widens the attack surface of your cluster. | update | 202 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-kubernetes-container-created-with-excessive-linux-capabilities, Kubernetes Container Created with Excessive Linux Capabilities>> | This rule detects a container deployed with one or more dangerously permissive Linux capabilities. An attacker with the ability to deploy a container with added capabilities could use this for further execution, lateral movement, or privilege escalation within a cluster. The capabilities detected in this rule have been used in container escapes to the host machine. | update | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostipc, Kubernetes Pod Created With HostIPC>> | This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a pod using the host IPC namespace. This gives access to data used by any pod that also use the hosts IPC namespace. If any process on the host or any processes in a pod uses the hosts inter-process communication mechanisms (shared memory, semaphore arrays, message queues, etc.), an attacker can read/write to those same mechanisms. They may look for files in /dev/shm or use ipcs to check for any IPC facilities being used. | update | 202 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostnetwork, Kubernetes Pod Created With HostNetwork>> | This rules detects an attempt to create or modify a pod attached to the host network. HostNetwork allows a pod to use the node network namespace. Doing so gives the pod access to any service running on localhost of the host. An attacker could use this access to snoop on network activity of other pods on the same node or bypass restrictive network policies applied to its given namespace. | update | 202 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostpid, Kubernetes Pod Created With HostPID>> | This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a pod attached to the host PID namespace. HostPID allows a pod to access all the processes running on the host and could allow an attacker to take malicious action. When paired with ptrace this can be used to escalate privileges outside of the container. When paired with a privileged container, the pod can see all of the processes on the host. An attacker can enter the init system (PID 1) on the host. From there, they could execute a shell and continue to escalate privileges to root. | update | 202 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-kubernetes-pod-created-with-a-sensitive-hostpath-volume, Kubernetes Pod created with a Sensitive hostPath Volume>> | This rule detects when a pod is created with a sensitive volume of type hostPath. A hostPath volume type mounts a sensitive file or folder from the node to the container. If the container gets compromised, the attacker can use this mount for gaining access to the node. There are many ways a container with unrestricted access to the host filesystem can escalate privileges, including reading data from other containers, and accessing tokens of more privileged pods. | update | 202 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-kubernetes-privileged-pod-created, Kubernetes Privileged Pod Created>> | This rule detects when a user creates a pod/container running in privileged mode. A highly privileged container has access to the node's resources and breaks the isolation between containers. If compromised, an attacker can use the privileged container to gain access to the underlying host. Gaining access to the host may provide the adversary with the opportunity to achieve follow-on objectives, such as establishing persistence, moving laterally within the environment, or setting up a command and control channel on the host. | update | 202 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-kubernetes-suspicious-assignment-of-controller-service-account, Kubernetes Suspicious Assignment of Controller Service Account>> | This rule detects a request to attach a controller service account to an existing or new pod running in the kube-system namespace. By default, controllers running as part of the API Server utilize admin-equivalent service accounts hosted in the kube-system namespace. Controller service accounts aren't normally assigned to running pods and could indicate adversary behavior within the cluster. An attacker that can create or modify pods or pod controllers in the kube-system namespace, can assign one of these admin-equivalent service accounts to a pod and abuse their powerful token to escalate privileges and gain complete cluster control. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-microsoft-365-inbox-forwarding-rule-created, Microsoft 365 Inbox Forwarding Rule Created>> | Identifies when a new Inbox forwarding rule is created in Microsoft 365. Inbox rules process messages in the Inbox based on conditions and take actions. In this case, the rules will forward the emails to a defined address. Attackers can abuse Inbox Rules to intercept and exfiltrate email data without making organization-wide configuration changes or having the corresponding privileges. | update | 102

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-o365-mailbox-audit-logging-bypass, O365 Mailbox Audit Logging Bypass>> | Detects the occurrence of mailbox audit bypass associations. The mailbox audit is responsible for logging specified mailbox events (like accessing a folder or a message or permanently deleting a message). However, actions taken by some authorized accounts, such as accounts used by third-party tools or accounts used for lawful monitoring, can create a large number of mailbox audit log entries and may not be of interest to your organization. Because of this, administrators can create bypass associations, allowing certain accounts to perform their tasks without being logged. Attackers can abuse this allowlist mechanism to conceal actions taken, as the mailbox audit will log no activity done by the account. | update | 102 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-microsoft-365-exchange-transport-rule-creation, Microsoft 365 Exchange Transport Rule Creation>> | Identifies a transport rule creation in Microsoft 365.

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-unusual-dns-activity, Unusual DNS Activity>> | A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual DNS query that indicate network activity with unusual DNS domains. This can be due to initial access, persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, when a user clicks on a link in a phishing email or opens a malicious document, a request may be sent to download and run a payload from an uncommon domain. When malware is already running, it may send requests to an uncommon DNS domain the malware uses for command-and-control communication. | update | 102 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-unusual-web-request, Unusual Web Request>> | A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual URL that indicates unusual web browsing activity. This can be due to initial access, persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, in a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack, when a trusted website is compromised to target a particular sector or organization, targeted users may receive emails with uncommon URLs for trusted websites. These URLs can be used to download and run a payload. When malware is already running, it may send requests to uncommon URLs on trusted websites the malware uses for command-and-control communication. When rare URLs are observed being requested for a local web server by a remote source, these can be due to web scanning, enumeration or attack traffic, or they can be due to bots and web scrapers which are part of common Internet background traffic. | update | 102 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-unusual-web-user-agent, Unusual Web User Agent>> | A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual user agent indicating web browsing activity by an unusual process other than a web browser. This can be due to persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. Uncommon user agents coming from remote sources to local destinations are often the result of scanners, bots, and web scrapers, which are part of common Internet background traffic. Much of this is noise, but more targeted attacks on websites using tools like Burp or SQLmap can sometimes be discovered by spotting uncommon user agents. Uncommon user agents in traffic from local sources to remote destinations can be any number of things, including harmless programs like weather monitoring or stock-trading programs. However, uncommon user agents from local sources can also be due to malware or scanning activity. | update | 102

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-suspicious-powershell-script, Suspicious Powershell Script>> | A machine learning job detected a PowerShell script with unusual data characteristics, such as obfuscation, that may be a characteristic of malicious PowerShell script text blocks. | update | 103 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-unusual-hour-for-a-user-to-logon, Unusual Hour for a User to Logon>> | A machine learning job detected a user logging in at a time of day that is unusual for the user. This can be due to credentialed access via a compromised account when the user and the threat actor are in different time zones. In addition, unauthorized user activity often takes place during non-business hours. | update | 103 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-unusual-source-ip-for-a-user-to-logon-from, Unusual Source IP for a User to Logon from>> | A machine learning job detected a user logging in from an IP address that is unusual for the user. This can be due to credentialed access via a compromised account when the user and the threat actor are in different locations. An unusual source IP address for a username could also be due to lateral movement when a compromised account is used to pivot between hosts. | update | 102 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-rare-user-logon, Rare User Logon>> | A machine learning job found an unusual user name in the authentication logs. An unusual user name is one way of detecting credentialed access by means of a new or dormant user account. An inactive user account (because the user has left the organization) that becomes active may be due to credentialed access using a compromised account password. Threat actors will sometimes also create new users as a means of persisting in a compromised web application. | update | 103 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-unusual-linux-username, Unusual Linux Username>> | A machine learning job detected activity for a username that is not normally active, which can indicate unauthorized changes, activity by unauthorized users, lateral movement, or compromised credentials. In many organizations, new usernames are not often created apart from specific types of system activities, such as creating new accounts for new employees. These user accounts quickly become active and routine. Events from rarely used usernames can point to suspicious activity. Additionally, automated Linux fleets tend to see activity from rarely used usernames only when personnel log in to make authorized or unauthorized changes, or threat actors have acquired credentials and log in for malicious purposes. Unusual usernames can also indicate pivoting, where compromised credentials are used to try and move laterally from one host to another. | update | 102 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-unusual-windows-username, Unusual Windows Username>> | A machine learning job detected activity for a username that is not normally active, which can indicate unauthorized changes, activity by unauthorized users, lateral movement, or compromised credentials.

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-unusual-print-spooler-child-process, Unusual Print Spooler Child Process>> | Detects unusual Print Spooler service (spoolsv.exe) child processes. This may indicate an attempt to exploit privilege escalation vulnerabilities related to the Printing Service on Windows. | update | 103 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-unusual-service-host-child-process-childless-service, Unusual Service Host Child Process - Childless Service>> | Identifies unusual child processes of Service Host (svchost.exe) that traditionally do not spawn any child processes. This may indicate a code injection or an equivalent form of exploitation. | update | 104 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-privileges-elevation-via-parent-process-pid-spoofing, Privileges Elevation via Parent Process PID Spoofing>> | Identifies parent process spoofing used to create an elevated child process. Adversaries may spoof the parent process identifier (PPID) of a new process to evade process-monitoring defenses or to elevate privileges. | update | 4 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-privilege-escalation-via-rogue-named-pipe-impersonation, Privilege Escalation via Rogue Named Pipe Impersonation>> | Identifies a privilege escalation attempt via rogue named pipe impersonation. An adversary may abuse this technique by masquerading as a known named pipe and manipulating a privileged process to connect to it. | update | 104 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-process-created-with-an-elevated-token, Process Created with an Elevated Token>> | Identifies the creation of a process running as SYSTEM and impersonating a Windows core binary privileges. Adversaries may create a new process with a different token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. | update | 4 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-7-windows-service-installed-via-an-unusual-client, Windows Service Installed via an Unusual Client>> | Identifies the creation of a Windows service by an unusual client process. Services may be created with administrator privileges but are executed under SYSTEM privileges, so an adversary may also use a service to escalate privileges from administrator to SYSTEM. | update | 105
