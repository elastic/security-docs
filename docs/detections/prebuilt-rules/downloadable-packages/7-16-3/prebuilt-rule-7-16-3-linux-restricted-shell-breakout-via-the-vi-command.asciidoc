=== Linux Restricted Shell Breakout via the vi command

Identifies Linux binary find abuse to break out from restricted environments by spawning an interactive system shell. The vi/vim editor is the standard text editor in Linux distributions, and the activity of spawning a shell is not a standard use of this binary by a user or system administrator. This could potentially indicate a malicious actor attempting to improve the capabilities or stability of their access.
