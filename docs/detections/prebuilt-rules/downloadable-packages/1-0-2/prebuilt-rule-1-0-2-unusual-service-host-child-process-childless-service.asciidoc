==== Investigation guide


[source, markdown]
----------------------------------
## Config

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

==== Rule query


[source, js]
----------------------------------
process where event.type in ("start", "process_started") and
     process.parent.name : "svchost.exe" and

     /* based on svchost service arguments -s svcname where the service is known to be childless */

    process.parent.args : ("WdiSystemHost","LicenseManager",
      "StorSvc","CDPSvc","cdbhsvc","BthAvctpSvc","SstpSvc","WdiServiceHost",
      "imgsvc","TrkWks","WpnService","IKEEXT","PolicyAgent","CryptSvc",

      /* unknown FPs can be added here */
