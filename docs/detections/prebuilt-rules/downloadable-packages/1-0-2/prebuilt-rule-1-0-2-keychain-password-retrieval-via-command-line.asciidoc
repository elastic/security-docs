=== Keychain Password Retrieval via Command Line

Adversaries may collect keychain storage data from a system to acquire credentials. Keychains are the built-in way for macOS to keep track of users' passwords and credentials for many services and features, including Wi-Fi and website passwords, secure notes, certificates, and Kerberos.

==== Investigation guide


[source, markdown]
----------------------------------
## Config

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

==== Rule query


[source, js]
----------------------------------
process where event.type == "start" and
 process.name : "security" and process.args : "-wa" and process.args : ("find-generic-password", "find-internet-password") and
 process.args : ("Chrome*", "Chromium", "Opera", "Safari*", "Brave", "Microsoft Edge", "Edge", "Firefox*") and
 not process.parent.executable : "/Applications/Keeper Password Manager.app/Contents/Frameworks/Keeper Password Manager Helper*/Contents/MacOS/Keeper Password Manager Helper*"
