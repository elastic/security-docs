=== Machine Learning Detected a Suspicious Windows Event with a High Malicious Probability Score

A supervised machine learning model (ProblemChild) has identified a suspicious Windows process event with high probability of it being malicious activity. Alternatively, the model's blocklist identified the event as being malicious.

==== Setup



*Setup*


The rule requires the Living off the Land (LotL) Attack Detection integration assets to be installed, as well as Windows process events collected by integrations such as Elastic Defend or Winlogbeat.  


*LotL Attack Detection Setup*

The LotL Attack Detection integration detects living-off-the-land activity in Windows process events.


*Prerequisite Requirements:*

- Fleet is required for LotL Attack Detection.
- To configure Fleet Server refer to the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html[documentation].
- Windows process events collected by the https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/endpoint[Elastic Defend] integration or Winlogbeat(https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/current/_winlogbeat_overview.html).
- To install Elastic Defend, refer to the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/install-endpoint.html[documentation].
- To set up and run Winlogbeat, follow https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/current/winlogbeat-installation-configuration.html[this] guide.


*The following steps should be executed to install assets associated with the LotL Attack Detection integration:*

- Go to the Kibana homepage. Under Management, click Integrations.
- In the query bar, search for Living off the Land Attack Detection and select the integration to see more details about it.
- Follow the instructions under the **Installation** section.
- For this rule to work, complete the instructions through **Configure the ingest pipeline**.
