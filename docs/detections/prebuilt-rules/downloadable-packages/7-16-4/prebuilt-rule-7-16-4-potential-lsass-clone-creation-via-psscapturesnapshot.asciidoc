=== Potential LSASS Clone Creation via PssCaptureSnapShot

Identifies the creation of an LSASS process clone via PssCaptureSnapShot where the parent process is the initial LSASS process instance. This may indicate an attempt to evade detection and dump LSASS memory for credential access.

==== Investigation guide


[source, markdown]
----------------------------------
## Setup

This is meant to run only on datasources using Windows security event 4688 that captures the process clone creation.

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

----------------------------------

==== Rule query


[source, js]
----------------------------------
process where event.code:"4688" and
  process.executable : "?:\\Windows\\System32\\lsass.exe" and
  process.parent.executable : "?:\\Windows\\System32\\lsass.exe"
