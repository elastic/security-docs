|<<prebuilt-rule-7-16-4-execution-with-explicit-credentials-via-scripting, Execution with Explicit Credentials via Scripting>> | Identifies execution of the security_authtrampoline process via a scripting interpreter. This occurs when programs use AuthorizationExecute-WithPrivileges from the Security.framework to run another program with root privileges. It should not be run by itself, as this is a sign of execution with explicit logon credentials. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-7-16-4-dns-tunneling, DNS Tunneling>> | A machine learning job detected unusually large numbers of DNS queries for a single top-level DNS domain, which is often used for DNS tunneling. DNS tunneling can be used for command-and-control, persistence, or data exfiltration activity. For example, dnscat tends to generate many DNS questions for a top-level domain as it uses the DNS protocol to tunnel data. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-7-16-4-unusual-dns-activity, Unusual DNS Activity>> | A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual DNS query that indicate network activity with unusual DNS domains. This can be due to initial access, persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, when a user clicks on a link in a phishing email or opens a malicious document, a request may be sent to download and run a payload from an uncommon domain. When malware is already running, it may send requests to an uncommon DNS domain the malware uses for command-and-control communication. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-7-16-4-unusual-web-request, Unusual Web Request>> | A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual URL that indicates unusual web browsing activity. This can be due to initial access, persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, in a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack, when a trusted website is compromised to target a particular sector or organization, targeted users may receive emails with uncommon URLs for trusted websites. These URLs can be used to download and run a payload. When malware is already running, it may send requests to uncommon URLs on trusted websites the malware uses for command-and-control communication. When rare URLs are observed being requested for a local web server by a remote source, these can be due to web scanning, enumeration or attack traffic, or they can be due to bots and web scrapers which are part of common Internet background traffic. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-7-16-4-unusual-web-user-agent, Unusual Web User Agent>> | A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual user agent indicating web browsing activity by an unusual process other than a web browser. This can be due to persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. Uncommon user agents coming from remote sources to local destinations are often the result of scanners, bots, and web scrapers, which are part of common Internet background traffic. Much of this is noise, but more targeted attacks on websites using tools like Burp or SQLmap can sometimes be discovered by spotting uncommon user agents. Uncommon user agents in traffic from local sources to remote destinations can be any number of things, including harmless programs like weather monitoring or stock-trading programs. However, uncommon user agents from local sources can also be due to malware or scanning activity. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-7-16-4-spike-in-failed-logon-events, Spike in Failed Logon Events>> | A machine learning job found an unusually large spike in authentication failure events. This can be due to password spraying, user enumeration or brute force activity and may be a precursor to account takeover or credentialed access. | update | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-7-16-4-spike-in-logon-events, Spike in Logon Events>> | A machine learning job found an unusually large spike in successful authentication events. This can be due to password spraying, user enumeration or brute force activity. | update | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-7-16-4-spike-in-logon-events-from-a-source-ip, Spike in Logon Events from a Source IP>> | A machine learning job found an unusually large spike in successful authentication events from a particular source IP address.

|<<prebuilt-rule-7-16-4-unusual-hour-for-a-user-to-logon, Unusual Hour for a User to Logon>> | A machine learning job detected a user logging in at a time of day that is unusual for the user. This can be due to credentialed access via a compromised account when the user and the threat actor are in different time zones. In addition, unauthorized user activity often takes place during non-business hours. | update | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-7-16-4-unusual-source-ip-for-a-user-to-logon-from, Unusual Source IP for a User to Logon from>> | A machine learning job detected a user logging in from an IP address that is unusual for the user. This can be due to credentialed access via a compromised account when the user and the threat actor are in different locations. An unusual source IP address for a username could also be due to lateral movement when a compromised account is used to pivot between hosts. | update | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-7-16-4-rare-user-logon, Rare User Logon>> | A machine learning job found an unusual user name in the authentication logs. An unusual user name is one way of detecting credentialed access by means of a new or dormant user account. An inactive user account (because the user has left the organization) that becomes active may be due to credentialed access using a compromised account password. Threat actors will sometimes also create new users as a means of persisting in a compromised web application. | update | 4
