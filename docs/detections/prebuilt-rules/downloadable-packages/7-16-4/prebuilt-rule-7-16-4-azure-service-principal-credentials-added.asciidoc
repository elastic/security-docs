[[prebuilt-rule-7-16-4-azure-service-principal-credentials-added]]
=== Azure Service Principal Credentials Added

Identifies when new Service Principal credentials have been added in Azure. In most organizations, credentials will be added to service principals infrequently. Hijacking an application (by adding a rogue secret or certificate) with granted permissions will allow the attacker to access data that is normally protected by MFA requirements.
