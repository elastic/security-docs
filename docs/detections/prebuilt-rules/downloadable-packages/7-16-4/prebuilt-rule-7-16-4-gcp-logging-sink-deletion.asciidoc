=== GCP Logging Sink Deletion

Identifies a logging sink deletion in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Every time a log entry arrives, it's compared to the sinks in that resource. Each sink whose filter matches the log entry writes a copy of the log entry to the sink's export destination. An adversary may delete a logging sink to evade detection.
