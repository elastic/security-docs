=== UAC Bypass Attempt with IEditionUpgradeManager Elevated COM Interface

Identifies attempts to bypass User Account Control (UAC) by abusing an elevated COM Interface to launch a rogue Windows ClipUp program. Attackers may attempt to bypass UAC to stealthily execute code with elevated permissions.

==== Investigation guide


[source, markdown]
----------------------------------
## Setup

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

==== Rule query


[source, js]
----------------------------------
process where event.type in ("start", "process_started") and process.name : "Clipup.exe" and
  not process.executable : "C:\\Windows\\System32\\ClipUp.exe" and process.parent.name : "dllhost.exe" and
  /* CLSID of the Elevated COM Interface IEditionUpgradeManager */
  process.parent.args : "/Processid:{BD54C901-076B-434E-B6C7-17C531F4AB41}"
