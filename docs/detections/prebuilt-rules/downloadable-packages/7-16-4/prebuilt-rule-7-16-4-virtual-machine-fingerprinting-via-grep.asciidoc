=== Virtual Machine Fingerprinting via Grep

An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about the operating system and hardware. This rule identifies common locations used to discover virtual machine hardware by a non-root user. This technique has been used by the Pupy RAT and other malware.

==== Investigation guide


[source, markdown]
----------------------------------
## Setup

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

----------------------------------

==== Rule query


[source, js]
----------------------------------
process where event.type == "start" and
 process.name in ("grep", "egrep") and user.id != "0" and
 process.args : ("parallels*", "vmware*", "virtualbox*") and process.args : "Manufacturer*" and
 not process.parent.executable in ("/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/MacOS/Docker", "/usr/libexec/kcare/virt-what")
