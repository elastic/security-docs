=== Searching for Saved Credentials via VaultCmd

Windows Credential Manager allows you to create, view, or delete saved credentials for signing into websites, connected applications, and networks. An adversary may abuse this to list or dump credentials stored in the Credential Manager for saved usernames and passwords. This may also be performed in preparation of lateral movement.

==== Investigation guide


[source, markdown]
----------------------------------
## Setup

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

----------------------------------

==== Rule query


[source, js]
----------------------------------
process where event.type in ("start", "process_started") and
  (process.pe.original_file_name:"vaultcmd.exe" or process.name:"vaultcmd.exe") and
  process.args:"/list*"
