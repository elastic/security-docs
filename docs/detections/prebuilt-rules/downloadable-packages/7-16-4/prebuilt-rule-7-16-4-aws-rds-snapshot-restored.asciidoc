[[prebuilt-rule-7-16-4-aws-rds-snapshot-restored]]
=== AWS RDS Snapshot Restored

Identifies when an attempt was made to restore an RDS Snapshot. Snapshots are sometimes shared by threat actors in order to exfiltrate bulk data or evade detection after performing malicious activities. If the permissions were modified, verify if the snapshot was shared with an unauthorized or unexpected AWS account.
