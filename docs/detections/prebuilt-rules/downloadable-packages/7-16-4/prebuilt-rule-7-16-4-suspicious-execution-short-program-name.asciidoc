==== Investigation guide


[source, markdown]
----------------------------------
## Setup

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

----------------------------------

==== Rule query


[source, js]
----------------------------------
process where event.type in ("start", "process_started") and length(process.name) > 0 and
 length(process.name) == 5 and host.os.name == "Windows" and length(process.pe.original_file_name) > 5
