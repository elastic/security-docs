=== Creation of Hidden Files and Directories via CommandLine

Users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a "." as the first character in the file or folder name. Adversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders on the system for persistence and defense evasion. This rule looks for hidden files or folders in common writable directories.

==== Investigation guide


[source, markdown]
----------------------------------
## Setup

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

----------------------------------

==== Rule query


[source, js]
----------------------------------
process where event.type in ("start", "process_started") and
  process.working_directory in ("/tmp", "/var/tmp", "/dev/shm") and
  process.args regex~ """\.[a-z0-9_\-][a-z0-9_\-\.]{1,254}""" and
  not process.name in ("ls", "find", "grep")
