|==============================================
|Rule |Description |Status |Version

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-12-24-aws-ec2-multi-region-describeinstances-api-calls, AWS EC2 Multi-Region DescribeInstances API Calls>> | Identifies when a single AWS resource is making `DescribeInstances` API calls in more than 10 regions within a 30-second window. This could indicate a potential threat actor attempting to discover the AWS infrastructure across multiple regions using compromised credentials or a compromised instance. Adversaries may use this information to identify potential targets for further exploitation or to gain a better understanding of the target's infrastructure. | new | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-12-24-aws-service-quotas-multi-region-getservicequota-requests, AWS Service Quotas Multi-Region `GetServiceQuota` Requests>> | Identifies when a single AWS resource is making `GetServiceQuota` API calls for the EC2 service quota L-1216C47A in more than 10 regions within a 30-second window. Quota code L-1216C47A represents on-demand instances which are used by adversaries to deploy malware and mine cryptocurrency. This could indicate a potential threat actor attempting to discover the AWS infrastructure across multiple regions using compromised credentials or a compromised instance. | new | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-12-24-attempts-to-brute-force-a-microsoft-365-user-account, Attempts to Brute Force a Microsoft 365 User Account>> | Identifies attempts to brute force a Microsoft 365 user account. An adversary may attempt a brute force attack to obtain unauthorized access to user accounts. | new | 210 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-12-24-successful-application-sso-from-rare-unknown-client-device, Successful Application SSO from Rare Unknown Client Device>> | Detects successful single sign-on (SSO) events to Okta applications from an unrecognized or "unknown" client device, as identified by the user-agent string. This activity may be indicative of exploitation of a vulnerability in Okta's Classic Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass application-specific sign-on policies, such as device or network restrictions. The vulnerability potentially enables unauthorized access to applications using only valid, stolen credentials, without requiring additional authentication factors. | new | 1
