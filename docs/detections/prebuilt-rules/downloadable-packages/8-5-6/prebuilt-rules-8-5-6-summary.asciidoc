|==============================================
|Rule |Description |Status |Version

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-6-unusual-file-creation-alternate-data-stream, Unusual File Creation - Alternate Data Stream>> | Identifies suspicious creation of Alternate Data Streams on highly targeted files. This is uncommon for legitimate files and sometimes done by adversaries to hide malware. | update | 107 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-6-remote-system-discovery-commands, Remote System Discovery Commands>> | Discovery of remote system information using built-in commands, which may be used to move laterally. | update | 106 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-6-suspicious-powershell-engine-imageload, Suspicious PowerShell Engine ImageLoad>> | Identifies the PowerShell engine being invoked by unexpected processes. Rather than executing PowerShell functionality with powershell.exe, some attackers do this to operate more stealthily. | update | 105 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-5-6-wmi-incoming-lateral-movement, WMI Incoming Lateral Movement>> | Identifies processes executed via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) on a remote host. This could be indicative of adversary lateral movement, but could be noisy if administrators use WMI to remotely manage hosts. | update | 104
