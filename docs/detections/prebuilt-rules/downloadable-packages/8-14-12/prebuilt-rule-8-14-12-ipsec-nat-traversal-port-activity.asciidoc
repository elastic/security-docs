[[prebuilt-rule-8-14-12-ipsec-nat-traversal-port-activity]]
=== IPSEC NAT Traversal Port Activity

This rule detects events that could be describing IPSEC NAT Traversal traffic. IPSEC is a VPN technology that allows one system to talk to another using encrypted tunnels. NAT Traversal enables these tunnels to communicate over the Internet where one of the sides is behind a NAT router gateway. This may be common on your network, but this technique is also used by threat actors to avoid detection.
