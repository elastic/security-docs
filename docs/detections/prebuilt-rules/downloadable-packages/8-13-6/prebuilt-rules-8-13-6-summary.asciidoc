This activity can be indicative of attempting to cause an increase in billing to an account for excessive random operations, cause resource exhaustion, or enumerating bucket names for discovery. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-13-6-aws-bedrock-guardrails-detected-multiple-violations-by-a-single-user-over-a-session, AWS Bedrock Guardrails Detected Multiple Violations by a Single User Over a Session>> | Identifies multiple violations of AWS Bedrock guardrails by the same user in the same account over a session. Multiple violations implies that a user may be intentionally attempting to cirvumvent security controls, access sensitive information, or possibly exploit a vulnerability in the system. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-13-6-aws-bedrock-guardrails-detected-multiple-policy-violations-within-a-single-blocked-request, AWS Bedrock Guardrails Detected Multiple Policy Violations Within a Single Blocked Request>> | Identifies multiple violations of AWS Bedrock guardrails within a single request, resulting in a block action, increasing the likelihood of malicious intent. Multiple violations implies that a user may be intentionally attempting to cirvumvent security controls, access sensitive information, or possibly exploit a vulnerability in the system. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-13-6-unusual-high-confidence-misconduct-blocks-detected, Unusual High Confidence Misconduct Blocks Detected>> | Detects repeated high-confidence 'BLOCKED' actions coupled with specific violation codes such as 'MISCONDUCT', indicating persistent misuse or attempts to probe the model's ethical boundaries. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-13-6-potential-abuse-of-resources-by-high-token-count-and-large-response-sizes, Potential Abuse of Resources by High Token Count and Large Response Sizes>> | Detects potential resource exhaustion or data breach attempts by monitoring for users who consistently generate high input token counts, submit numerous requests, and receive large responses. This behavior could indicate an attempt to overload the system or extract an unusually large amount of data, possibly revealing sensitive information or causing service disruptions. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-13-6-aws-bedrock-detected-multiple-attempts-to-use-denied-models-by-a-single-user, AWS Bedrock Detected Multiple Attempts to use Denied Models by a Single User>> | Identifies multiple successive failed attempts to use denied model resources within AWS Bedrock.
