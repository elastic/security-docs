[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
|Rule |Description |Status |Version

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-yum-dnf-plugin-status-discovery, Yum/DNF Plugin Status Discovery>> | This rule detects the execution of the `grep` command with the `plugins` argument on Linux systems. This command is used to search for YUM/DNF configurations and/or plugins with an enabled state. This behavior may indicate an attacker is attempting to establish persistence in a YUM or DNF plugin. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-dnf-package-manager-plugin-file-creation, DNF Package Manager Plugin File Creation>> | Detects file creation events in the plugin directories for the Yum package manager. In Linux, DNF (Dandified YUM) is a command-line utility used for handling packages on Fedora-based systems, providing functions for installing, updating, upgrading, and removing software along with managing package repositories. Attackers can backdoor DNF to gain persistence by injecting malicious code into plugins that DNF runs, thereby ensuring continued unauthorized access or control each time DNF is used for package management. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-git-hook-created-or-modified, Git Hook Created or Modified>> | This rule detects the creation or modification of a Git hook file on a Linux system. Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, and receive. They are used to automate tasks, enforce policies, and customize Git's behavior. Attackers can abuse Git hooks to maintain persistence on a system by executing malicious code whenever a specific Git event occurs. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-git-hook-child-process, Git Hook Child Process>> | This rule detects child processes spawned by Git hooks. Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commit, push, and receive. The rule identifies child processes spawned by Git hooks that are not typically spawned by the Git process itself. This behavior may indicate an attacker attempting to hide malicious activity by leveraging the legitimate Git process to execute unauthorized commands. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-suspicious-rc-local-error-message, Suspicious rc.local Error Message>> | This rule monitors the syslog log file for error messages related to the rc.local process. The rc.local file is a script that is executed during the boot process on Linux systems. Attackers may attempt to modify the rc.local file to execute malicious commands or scripts during system startup. This rule detects error messages such as "Connection refused," "No such file or directory," or "command not found" in the syslog log file, which may indicate that the rc.local file has been tampered with. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-potential-execution-of-rc-local-script, Potential Execution of rc.local Script>> | This rule detects the potential execution of the `/etc/rc.local` script through the `already_running` event action created by the `rc-local.service` systemd service. The `/etc/rc.local` script is a legacy initialization script that is executed at the end of the boot process. The `/etc/rc.local` script is not enabled by default on most Linux distributions. The `/etc/rc.local` script can be used by attackers to persistently execute malicious commands or scripts on a compromised system at reboot. As the rc.local file is executed prior to the initialization of Elastic Defend, the execution event is not ingested, and therefore the `already_running` event is leveraged to provide insight into the potential execution of `rc.local`. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-systemd-generator-created, Systemd Generator Created>> | This rule detects the creation of a systemd generator file. Generators are small executables executed by systemd at bootup and during configuration reloads. Their main role is to convert non-native configuration and execution parameters into dynamically generated unit files, symlinks, or drop-ins, extending the unit file hierarchy for the service manager. Systemd generators can be used to execute arbitrary code at boot time, which can be leveraged by attackers to maintain persistence on a Linux system. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-user-or-group-creation-modification, User or Group Creation/Modification>> | This rule leverages the `auditd_manager` integration to detect user or group creation or modification events on Linux systems. Threat actors may attempt to create or modify users or groups to establish persistence on the system. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-yum-package-manager-plugin-file-creation, Yum Package Manager Plugin File Creation>> | Detects file creation events in the plugin directories for the Yum package manager.  In Linux, Yum (Yellowdog Updater, Modified) is a command-line utility used for handling packages on (by default) Fedora-based systems, providing functions for installing, updating, upgrading, and removing software along with managing package repositories. Attackers can backdoor Yum to gain persistence by injecting malicious code into plugins that Yum runs, thereby ensuring continued unauthorized access or control each time Yum is used for package management. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-privilege-escalation-via-suid-sgid, Privilege Escalation via SUID/SGID>> | Identifies instances where a process is executed with user/group ID 0 (root), and a real user/group ID that is not 0. This is indicative of a process that has been granted SUID/SGID permissions, allowing it to run with elevated privileges. Attackers may leverage a misconfiguration for exploitation in order to escalate their privileges to root, or establish a backdoor for persistence. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-microsoft-management-console-file-from-unusual-path, Microsoft Management Console File from Unusual Path>> | Identifies attempts to open a Microsoft Management Console File from untrusted paths. Adversaries may use MSC files for initial access and execution. | new | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-active-directory-group-modification-by-system, Active Directory Group Modification by SYSTEM>> | Identifies a user being added to an active directory group by the SYSTEM (S-1-5-18) user. This behavior can indicate that the attacker has achieved SYSTEM privileges in a domain controller, which attackers can obtain by exploiting vulnerabilities or abusing default group privileges (e.g., Server Operators), and is attempting to pivot to a domain account. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-suid-sgid-bit-set, SUID/SGID Bit Set>> | An adversary may add the setuid or setgid bit to a file or directory in order to run a file with the privileges of the owning user or group. An adversary can take advantage of this to either do a shell escape or exploit a vulnerability in an application with the setuid or setgid bit to get code running in a different userâ€™s context. Additionally, adversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure they're able to execute in elevated contexts in the future. | update | 104 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-suspicious-file-creation-in-etc-for-persistence, Suspicious File Creation in /etc for Persistence>> | Detects the manual creation of files in specific etc directories, via user root, used by Linux malware to persist and elevate privileges on compromised systems. File creation in these directories should not be entirely common and could indicate a malicious binary or script installing persistence mechanisms for long term access. | update | 115 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-system-v-init-script-created, System V Init Script Created>> | Files that are placed in the /etc/init.d/ directory in Unix can be used to start custom applications, services, scripts or commands during start-up. Init.d has been mostly replaced in favor of Systemd. However, the "systemd-sysv-generator" can convert init.d files to service unit files that run at boot. Adversaries may add or alter files located in the /etc/init.d/ directory to execute malicious code upon boot in order to gain persistence on the system. | update | 11 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-executable-bit-set-for-potential-persistence-script, Executable Bit Set for Potential Persistence Script>> | This rule monitors for the addition of an executable bit for scripts that are located in directories which are commonly abused for persistence. An alert of this rule is an indicator that a persistence mechanism is being set up within your environment. Adversaries may create these scripts to execute malicious code at start-up, or at a set interval to gain persistence onto the system. | update | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-rc-local-rc-common-file-creation, rc.local/rc.common File Creation>> | This rule monitors the creation/alteration of the rc.local/rc.common file. The /etc/rc.local file is used to start custom applications, services, scripts or commands during start-up. The rc.local file has mostly been replaced by Systemd. However, through the "systemd-rc-local-generator", rc.local files can be converted to services that run at boot. Adversaries may alter rc.local/rc.common to execute malicious code at start-up, and gain persistence onto the system. | update | 112 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-systemd-timer-created, Systemd Timer Created>> | Detects the creation of a systemd timer within any of the default systemd timer directories. Systemd timers can be used by an attacker to gain persistence, by scheduling the execution of a command or script. Similarly to cron/at, systemd timers can be set up to execute on boot time, or on a specific point in time, which allows attackers to regain access in case the connection to the infected asset was lost. | update | 12 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-systemd-service-created, Systemd Service Created>> | This rule detects the creation or renaming of a new Systemd file in all of the common Systemd service locations for both root and regular users. Systemd service files are configuration files in Linux systems used to define and manage system services. Malicious actors can leverage systemd service files to achieve persistence by creating or modifying services to execute malicious commands or payloads during system startup or at a predefined interval by adding a systemd timer. This allows them to maintain unauthorized access, execute additional malicious activities, or evade detection. | update | 12 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-lsass-process-access-via-windows-api, LSASS Process Access via Windows API>> | Identifies access attempts to the LSASS handle, which may indicate an attempt to dump credentials from LSASS memory. | update | 8 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-executable-file-creation-with-multiple-extensions, Executable File Creation with Multiple Extensions>> | Masquerading can allow an adversary to evade defenses and better blend in with the environment. One way it occurs is when the name or location of a file is manipulated as a means of tricking a user into executing what they think is a benign file type but is actually executable code. | update | 109 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-program-files-directory-masquerading, Program Files Directory Masquerading>> | Identifies execution from a directory masquerading as the Windows Program Files directories. These paths are trusted and usually host trusted third party programs. An adversary may leverage masquerading, along with low privileges to bypass detections allowlisting those folders. | update | 110 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-microsoft-windows-defender-tampering, Microsoft Windows Defender Tampering>> | Identifies when one or more features on Microsoft Defender are disabled. Adversaries may disable or tamper with Microsoft Defender features to evade detection and conceal malicious behavior. | update | 112 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-potential-evasion-via-filter-manager, Potential Evasion via Filter Manager>> | The Filter Manager Control Program (fltMC.exe) binary may be abused by adversaries to unload a filter driver and evade defenses. | update | 111 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-whoami-process-activity, Whoami Process Activity>> | Identifies suspicious use of whoami.exe which displays user, group, and privileges information for the user who is currently logged on to the local system. | update | 112 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-suspicious-jetbrains-teamcity-child-process, Suspicious JetBrains TeamCity Child Process>> | Identifies suspicious processes being spawned by the JetBrain TeamCity process. This activity could be related to JetBrains remote code execution vulnerabilities. | update | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-20-bypass-uac-via-event-viewer, Bypass UAC via Event Viewer>> | Identifies User Account Control (UAC) bypass via eventvwr.exe. Attackers bypass UAC to stealthily execute code with elevated permissions. | update | 113
