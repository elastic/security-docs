==== Investigation guide

----------------------------------
## Setup
Elastic Defend integration does not collect environment variable logging by default.
In order to capture this behavior, this rule requires a specific configuration option set within the advanced settings
of the Elastic Defend integration.
To set up environment variable capture for an Elastic Agent policy:
- Go to Security → Manage → Policies.
- Select an Elastic Agent policy.
- Click Show advanced settings.
- Scroll down or search for linux.advanced.capture_env_vars.
- Enter the names of env vars you want to capture, separated by commas.
- For this rule the linux.advanced.capture_env_vars variable should be set to "GLIBC_TUNABLES".
- Click Save.
After saving the integration change, the Elastic Agents running this policy will be updated and
the rule will function properly.
