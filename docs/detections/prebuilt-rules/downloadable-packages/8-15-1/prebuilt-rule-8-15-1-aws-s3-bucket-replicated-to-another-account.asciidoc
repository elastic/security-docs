=== AWS S3 Bucket Replicated to Another Account

Identifies when the `PutBucketReplication` operation is used to replicate S3 objects to a bucket in another AWS account. Adversaries may use bucket replication to exfiltrate sensitive data to an environment they control.

*Triage and Analysis*



*Investigating AWS S3 Bucket Replicated to Another Account*


This rule identifies when an S3 bucket is replicated to another AWS account. While sharing bucket replication is a common practice, adversaries may exploit this feature to exfiltrate data by replicating objects to external accounts under their control.


*Possible Investigation Steps*


- **Identify the Actor**: Review the `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` and `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` fields to identify who made the change. Verify if this actor typically performs such actions and if they have the necessary permissions.
- **Review the Sharing Event**: Identify the S3 bucket involved and review the event details. Look for `PutBucketReplication` actions where an `Account` key-value pair is included signifying replication to an external account.
    - **Request and Response Parameters**: Check the `aws.cloudtrail.request_parameters` and `aws.cloudtrail.response_elements` fields in the CloudTrail event to identify the role used and account ID where the bucket was replicated.
- **Verify the Shared Bucket**: Check the S3 bucket that was replicated and its contents to determine the sensitivity of the data stored within it.
- **Validate External Account**: Examine the AWS account to which the bucket was replicated. Determine whether this account is known and previously authorized to access such resources.
- **Contextualize with Recent Changes**: Compare this sharing event against recent changes in S3 configurations. Look for any other recent permissions changes or unusual administrative actions.
- **Correlate with Other Activities**: Search for related CloudTrail events before and after this change to see if the same actor or IP address engaged in other potentially suspicious activities.
- **Interview Relevant Personnel**: If the share was initiated by a user, verify the intent and authorization for this action with the person or team responsible for managing DB backups and snapshots.


*False Positive Analysis*


- **Legitimate Backup Actions**: Confirm if the S3 bucket replication aligns with scheduled backups or legitimate automation tasks.
- **Consistency Check**: Compare the action against historical data of similar actions performed by the user or within the organization. If the action is consistent with past legitimate activities, it might indicate a false alarm.


*Response and Remediation*


- **Immediate Review and Reversal**: If the change was unauthorized, update the S3 configurations to remove any unauthorized replication rules.
- **Enhance Monitoring and Alerts**: Adjust monitoring systems to alert on similar actions, especially those involving sensitive data or permissions.
- **Policy Update**: Review and possibly update your organizationâ€™s policies on S3 bucket/object sharing to tighten control and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Incident Response**: If malicious intent is confirmed, consider it a data breach incident and initiate the incident response protocol. This includes further investigation, containment, and recovery.
