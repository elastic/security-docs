=== Access to Keychain Credentials Directories

Adversaries may collect the keychain storage data from a system to acquire credentials. Keychains are the built-in way for macOS to keep track of users' passwords and credentials for many services and features such as Wi-Fi passwords, websites, secure notes, and certificates.

==== Investigation guide


[source, markdown]
----------------------------------
## Config

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

==== Rule query

process where event.type in ("start", "process_started") and
  process.args :
    (

      "/Network/Library/Keychains/*",

      "login.keychain-db",
      "login.keychain"
    ) and
