==== Investigation guide


[source, markdown]
----------------------------------
## Config

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

==== Rule query

process where event.type in ("start", "process_started") and
  process.name : "conhost.exe" and
  process.parent.name : ("svchost.exe", "lsass.exe", "services.exe", "smss.exe", "winlogon.exe", "explorer.exe",
                         "dllhost.exe", "rundll32.exe", "regsvr32.exe", "userinit.exe", "wininit.exe", "spoolsv.exe",
