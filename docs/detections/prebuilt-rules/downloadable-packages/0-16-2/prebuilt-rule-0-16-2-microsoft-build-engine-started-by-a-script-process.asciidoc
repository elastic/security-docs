==== Investigation guide


[source, markdown]
----------------------------------
## Config

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

==== Rule query

----------------------------------
process where event.type == "start" and
  (process.name : "MSBuild.exe" or process.pe.original_file_name == "MSBuild.exe") and
  process.parent.name : ("cmd.exe", "powershell.exe", "pwsh.exe", "powershell_ise.exe", "cscript.exe", "wscript.exe", "mshta.exe")
