|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-linux-init-pid-1-secret-dump-via-gdb, Linux init (PID 1) Secret Dump via GDB>> | This rule monitors for the potential memory dump of the init process (PID 1) through gdb. Attackers may leverage memory dumping techniques to attempt secret extraction from privileged processes. Tools that display this behavior include "truffleproc" and "bash-memory-dump". This behavior should not happen by default, and should be investigated thoroughly. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-system-binary-copied-and-or-moved-to-suspicious-directory, System Binary Copied and/or Moved to Suspicious Directory>> | This rule monitors for the copying or moving of a system binary to a suspicious directory. Adversaries may copy/move and rename system binaries to evade detection. Copying a system binary to a different location should not occur often, so if it does, the activity should be investigated. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-potential-disabling-of-apparmor, Potential Disabling of AppArmor>> | This rule monitors for potential attempts to disable AppArmor. AppArmor is a Linux security module that enforces fine-grained access control policies to restrict the actions and resources that specific applications and processes can access. Adversaries may disable security tools to avoid possible detection of their tools and activities. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-unusual-user-privilege-enumeration-via-id, Unusual User Privilege Enumeration via id>> | This rule monitors for a sequence of 20 "id" command executions within 1 second by the same parent process.

The rule targets specific VM-related paths, such as "/etc/vmware/", "/usr/lib/vmware/", or "/vmfs/*". These paths are associated with VMware virtualization software, and their presence in the touch command arguments may indicate that a threat actor is attempting to tamper with timestamps of VM-related files and configurations on the system. | update | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-file-deletion-via-shred, File Deletion via Shred>> | Malware or other files dropped or created on a system by an adversary may leave traces behind as to what was done within a network and how. Adversaries may remove these files over the course of an intrusion to keep their footprint low or remove them at the end as part of the post-intrusion cleanup process. | update | 105 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-file-permission-modification-in-writable-directory, File Permission Modification in Writable Directory>> | Identifies file permission modifications in common writable directories by a non-root user. Adversaries often drop files or payloads into a writable directory and change permissions prior to execution. | update | 105 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-creation-of-hidden-files-and-directories-via-commandline, Creation of Hidden Files and Directories via CommandLine>> | Users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a "." as the first character in the file or folder name. Adversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders on the system for persistence and defense evasion. This rule looks for hidden files or folders in common writable directories. | update | 104 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-creation-of-hidden-shared-object-file, Creation of Hidden Shared Object File>> | Identifies the creation of a hidden shared object (.so) file.

Adversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders on the system for persistence and defense evasion. | update | 105 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-kernel-module-removal, Kernel Module Removal>> | Kernel modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. This rule identifies attempts to remove a kernel module. | update | 105 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-deprecated-potential-process-injection-via-ld-preload-environment-variable, Deprecated - Potential Process Injection via LD_PRELOAD Environment Variable>> | This rule detects the execution of a process where the LD_PRELOAD environment variable is set. LD_PRELOAD can be used to inject a shared library into a binary at or prior to execution. A threat actor may do this in order to load a malicious shared library for the purposes of persistence, privilege escalation, and defense evasion. This activity is not common and will potentially indicate malicious or suspicious behavior. | update | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-system-log-file-deletion, System Log File Deletion>> | Identifies the deletion of sensitive Linux system logs. This may indicate an attempt to evade detection or destroy forensic evidence on a system. | update | 106 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-potential-hidden-process-via-mount-hidepid, Potential Hidden Process via Mount Hidepid>> | Identifies the execution of mount process with hidepid parameter, which can make processes invisible to other users from the system. Adversaries using Linux kernel version 3.2+ (or RHEL/CentOS v6.5+ above) can hide the process from other users. When hidepid=2 option is executed to mount the /proc filesystem, only the root user can see all processes and the logged-in user can only see their own process. This provides a defense evasion mechanism for the adversaries to hide their process executions from all other commands such as ps, top, pgrep and more. With the Linux kernel hardening hidepid option all the user has to do is remount the /proc filesystem with the option, which can now be monitored and detected. | update | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-potential-defense-evasion-via-proot, Potential Defense Evasion via PRoot>> | Identifies the execution of the PRoot utility, an open-source tool for user-space implementation of chroot, mount --bind, and binfmt_misc. Adversaries can leverage an open-source tool PRoot to expand the scope of their operations to multiple Linux distributions and simplify their necessary efforts. In a normal threat scenario, the scope of an attack is limited by the varying configurations of each Linux distribution. With PRoot, it provides an attacker with a consistent operational environment across different Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and Alpine. PRoot also provides emulation capabilities that allow for malware built on other architectures, such as ARM, to be run.The post-exploitation technique called bring your own filesystem (BYOF), can be used by the threat actors to execute malicious payload or elevate privileges or perform network scans or orchestrate another attack on the environment. Although PRoot was originally not developed with malicious intent it can be easily tuned to work for one. | update | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-suspicious-renaming-of-esxi-files, Suspicious Renaming of ESXI Files>> | Identifies instances where VMware-related files, such as those with extensions like ".vmdk", ".vmx", ".vmxf", ".vmsd", ".vmsn", ".vswp", ".vmss", ".nvram", and ".vmem", are renamed on a Linux system. The rule monitors for the "rename" event action associated with these file types, which could indicate malicious activity. | update | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-suspicious-renaming-of-esxi-index-html-file, Suspicious Renaming of ESXI index.html File>> | Identifies instances where the "index.html" file within the "/usr/lib/vmware/*" directory is renamed on a Linux system. The rule monitors for the "rename" event action associated with this specific file and path, which could indicate malicious activity. | update | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-esxi-discovery-via-find, ESXI Discovery via Find>> | Identifies instances where the 'find' command is started on a Linux system with arguments targeting specific VM-related paths, such as "/etc/vmware/", "/usr/lib/vmware/", or "/vmfs/*". These paths are associated with VMware virtualization software, and their presence in the find command arguments may indicate that a threat actor is attempting to search for, analyze, or manipulate VM-related files and configurations on the system. | update | 3

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-unusual-dns-activity, Unusual DNS Activity>> | A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual DNS query that indicate network activity with unusual DNS domains. This can be due to initial access, persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, when a user clicks on a link in a phishing email or opens a malicious document, a request may be sent to download and run a payload from an uncommon domain. When malware is already running, it may send requests to an uncommon DNS domain the malware uses for command-and-control communication. | update | 103 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-unusual-web-request, Unusual Web Request>> | A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual URL that indicates unusual web browsing activity. This can be due to initial access, persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, in a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack, when a trusted website is compromised to target a particular sector or organization, targeted users may receive emails with uncommon URLs for trusted websites. These URLs can be used to download and run a payload. When malware is already running, it may send requests to uncommon URLs on trusted websites the malware uses for command-and-control communication. When rare URLs are observed being requested for a local web server by a remote source, these can be due to web scanning, enumeration or attack traffic, or they can be due to bots and web scrapers which are part of common Internet background traffic. | update | 103 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-unusual-web-user-agent, Unusual Web User Agent>> | A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual user agent indicating web browsing activity by an unusual process other than a web browser. This can be due to persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. Uncommon user agents coming from remote sources to local destinations are often the result of scanners, bots, and web scrapers, which are part of common Internet background traffic. Much of this is noise, but more targeted attacks on websites using tools like Burp or SQLmap can sometimes be discovered by spotting uncommon user agents. Uncommon user agents in traffic from local sources to remote destinations can be any number of things, including harmless programs like weather monitoring or stock-trading programs. However, uncommon user agents from local sources can also be due to malware or scanning activity. | update | 103

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-suspicious-powershell-script, Suspicious Powershell Script>> | A machine learning job detected a PowerShell script with unusual data characteristics, such as obfuscation, that may be a characteristic of malicious PowerShell script text blocks. | update | 104 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-unusual-hour-for-a-user-to-logon, Unusual Hour for a User to Logon>> | A machine learning job detected a user logging in at a time of day that is unusual for the user. This can be due to credentialed access via a compromised account when the user and the threat actor are in different time zones. In addition, unauthorized user activity often takes place during non-business hours. | update | 104 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-unusual-source-ip-for-a-user-to-logon-from, Unusual Source IP for a User to Logon from>> | A machine learning job detected a user logging in from an IP address that is unusual for the user. This can be due to credentialed access via a compromised account when the user and the threat actor are in different locations. An unusual source IP address for a username could also be due to lateral movement when a compromised account is used to pivot between hosts. | update | 103 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-rare-user-logon, Rare User Logon>> | A machine learning job found an unusual user name in the authentication logs. An unusual user name is one way of detecting credentialed access by means of a new or dormant user account. An inactive user account (because the user has left the organization) that becomes active may be due to credentialed access using a compromised account password. Threat actors will sometimes also create new users as a means of persisting in a compromised web application. | update | 104 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-unusual-linux-username, Unusual Linux Username>> | A machine learning job detected activity for a username that is not normally active, which can indicate unauthorized changes, activity by unauthorized users, lateral movement, or compromised credentials. In many organizations, new usernames are not often created apart from specific types of system activities, such as creating new accounts for new employees. These user accounts quickly become active and routine. Events from rarely used usernames can point to suspicious activity. Additionally, automated Linux fleets tend to see activity from rarely used usernames only when personnel log in to make authorized or unauthorized changes, or threat actors have acquired credentials and log in for malicious purposes. Unusual usernames can also indicate pivoting, where compromised credentials are used to try and move laterally from one host to another. | update | 103 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-unusual-windows-username, Unusual Windows Username>> | A machine learning job detected activity for a username that is not normally active, which can indicate unauthorized changes, activity by unauthorized users, lateral movement, or compromised credentials.

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-spike-in-firewall-denies, Spike in Firewall Denies>> | A machine learning job detected an unusually large spike in network traffic that was denied by network access control lists (ACLs) or firewall rules. Such a burst of denied traffic is usually caused by either 1) a mis-configured application or firewall or 2) suspicious or malicious activity. Unsuccessful attempts at network transit, in order to connect to command-and-control (C2), or engage in data exfiltration, may produce a burst of failed connections. This could also be due to unusually large amounts of reconnaissance or enumeration traffic. Denial-of-service attacks or traffic floods may also produce such a surge in traffic. | update | 103 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-9-5-spike-in-network-traffic, Spike in Network Traffic>> | A machine learning job detected an unusually large spike in network traffic. Such a burst of traffic, if not caused by a surge in business activity, can be due to suspicious or malicious activity.
