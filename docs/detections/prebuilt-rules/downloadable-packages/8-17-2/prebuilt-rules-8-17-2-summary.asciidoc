|==============================================
|Rule |Description |Status |Version

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-2-azure-entra-mfa-totp-brute-force-attempts, Azure Entra MFA TOTP Brute Force Attempts>> | Identifies brute force attempts against Azure Entra multi-factor authentication (MFA) Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) verification codes. This rule detects high frequency failed TOTP code attempts for a single user in a short time-span. Adversaries with valid credentials, when attempting to login to Azure portal or other Azure services, may be prompted to provide a TOTP code as part of the MFA process. If successful, adversaries can bypass MFA and gain unauthorized access to Azure resources. | new | 1

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-2-simple-http-web-server-connection, Simple HTTP Web Server Connection>> | This rule detects connections accepted by a simple HTTP web server in Python and PHP built-in modules. Adversaries may create simple HTTP web servers to establish persistence on a compromised system by uploading a reverse or command shell payload to the server web root, allowing them to regain remote access to the system if lost. This event may occur when an attacker requests the server to execute a command or script via a potential backdoor. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-2-simple-http-web-server-creation, Simple HTTP Web Server Creation>> | This rule detects the creation of a simple HTTP web server using PHP or Python built-in modules.

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-2-unusual-sshd-child-process, Unusual SSHD Child Process>> | This rule detects the creation of an unusual SSHD child process through the usage of the `new_terms` rule type. Attackers may abuse SSH to maintain persistence on a compromised system, or to establish a backdoor for remote access, potentially resulting in an unusual SSHD child process being created. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-2-my-first-rule, My First Rule>> | This rule helps you test and practice using alerts with Elastic Security as you get set up. Itâ€™s not a sign of threat activity. | update | 4 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-2-rapid-secret-retrieval-attempts-from-aws-secretsmanager, Rapid Secret Retrieval Attempts from AWS SecretsManager>> | This rule attempts to identify rapid secret retrieval attempts from AWS SecretsManager.

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-2-endpoint-security-elastic-defend, Endpoint Security (Elastic Defend)>> | Generates a detection alert each time an Elastic Defend alert is received. Enabling this rule allows you to immediately begin investigating your Endpoint alerts. | update | 104 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-2-potential-persistence-via-file-modification, Potential Persistence via File Modification>> | This rule leverages the File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) integration to detect file modifications of files that are commonly used for persistence on Linux systems. The rule detects modifications to files that are commonly used for cron jobs, systemd services, message-of-the-day (MOTD), SSH configurations, shell configurations, runtime control, init daemon, passwd/sudoers/shadow files, Systemd udevd, and XDG/KDE autostart entries. To leverage this rule, the paths specified in the query need to be added to the FIM policy in the Elastic Security app. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-2-multiple-okta-sessions-detected-for-a-single-user, Multiple Okta Sessions Detected for a Single User>> | Detects when a user has started multiple Okta sessions with the same user account and different session IDs.

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-2-creation-or-modification-of-pluggable-authentication-module-or-configuration, Creation or Modification of Pluggable Authentication Module or Configuration>> | This rule monitors for the creation or modification of Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) shared object files or configuration files. Attackers may create or modify these files to maintain persistence on a compromised system, or harvest account credentials. | update | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-2-suspicious-antimalware-scan-interface-dll, Suspicious Antimalware Scan Interface DLL>> | Identifies the creation of the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) DLL in an unusual location.

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-2-remote-execution-via-file-shares, Remote Execution via File Shares>> | Identifies the execution of a file that was created by the virtual system process. This may indicate lateral movement via network file shares. | update | 115 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-2-uncommon-registry-persistence-change, Uncommon Registry Persistence Change>> | Detects changes to registry persistence keys that are not commonly used or modified by legitimate programs. This could be an indication of an adversary's attempt to persist in a stealthy manner. | update | 212 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-17-2-suspicious-wmi-event-subscription-created, Suspicious WMI Event Subscription Created>> | Detects the creation of a WMI Event Subscription. Attackers can abuse this mechanism for persistence or to elevate to SYSTEM privileges. | update | 306
