[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
|Rule |Description |Status |Version

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-sudo-command-enumeration-detected, Sudo Command Enumeration Detected>> | This rule monitors for the usage of the sudo -l command, which is used to list the allowed and forbidden commands for the invoking user. Attackers may execute this command to enumerate commands allowed to be executed with sudo permissions, potentially allowing to escalate privileges to root. | new | 1

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-suid-sguid-enumeration-detected, SUID/SGUID Enumeration Detected>> | This rule monitors for the usage of the "find" command in conjunction with SUID and SGUID permission arguments. SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID) are special permissions in Linux that allow a program to execute with the privileges of the file owner or group, respectively, rather than the privileges of the user running the program. In case an attacker is able to enumerate and find a binary that is misconfigured, they might be able to leverage this misconfiguration to escalate privileges by exploiting vulnerabilities or built-in features in the privileged program. | new | 1

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-potential-unauthorized-access-via-wildcard-injection-detected, Potential Unauthorized Access via Wildcard Injection Detected>> | This rule monitors for the execution of the "chown" and "chmod" commands with command line flags that could indicate a wildcard injection attack. Linux wildcard injection is a type of security vulnerability where attackers manipulate commands or input containing wildcards (e.g., *, ?, []) to execute unintended operations or access sensitive data by tricking the system into interpreting the wildcard characters in unexpected ways. | new | 1

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-potential-privilege-escalation-via-container-misconfiguration, Potential Privilege Escalation via Container Misconfiguration>> | This rule monitors for the execution of processes that interact with Linux containers through an interactive shell without root permissions. Utilities such as runc and ctr are universal command-line utilities leveraged to interact with containers via root permissions. On systems where the access to these utilities are misconfigured, attackers might be able to create and run a container that mounts the root folder or spawn a privileged container vulnerable to a container escape attack, which might allow them to escalate privileges and gain further access onto the host file system. | new | 1

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-suspicious-symbolic-link-created, Suspicious Symbolic Link Created>> | Identifies the creation of a symbolic link to a suspicious file or location. A symbolic link is a reference to a file or directory that acts as a pointer or shortcut, allowing users to access the target file or directory from a different location in the file system. An attacker can potentially leverage symbolic links for privilege escalation by tricking a privileged process into following the symbolic link to a sensitive file, giving the attacker access to data or capabilities they would not normally have. | new | 1

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-potential-privilege-escalation-via-uid-int-max-bug-detected, Potential Privilege Escalation via UID INT_MAX Bug Detected>> | This rule monitors for the execution of the systemd-run command by a user with a UID that is larger than the maximum allowed UID size (INT_MAX). Some older Linux versions were affected by a bug which allows user accounts with a UID greater than INT_MAX to escalate privileges by spawning a shell through systemd-run. | new | 1

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-potential-shell-via-wildcard-injection-detected, Potential Shell via Wildcard Injection Detected>> | This rule monitors for the execution of a set of linux binaries, that are potentially vulnerable to wildcard injection, with suspicious command line flags followed by a shell spawn event. Linux wildcard injection is a type of security vulnerability where attackers manipulate commands or input containing wildcards (e.g., *, ?, []) to execute unintended operations or access sensitive data by tricking the system into interpreting the wildcard characters in unexpected ways. | new | 1

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-potential-suspicious-debugfs-root-device-access, Potential Suspicious DebugFS Root Device Access>> | This rule monitors for the usage of the built-in Linux DebugFS utility to access a disk device without root permissions. Linux users that are part of the "disk" group have sufficient privileges to access all data inside of the machine through DebugFS. Attackers may leverage DebugFS in conjunction with "disk" permissions to read sensitive files owned by root, such as the shadow file, root ssh private keys or other sensitive files that may allow them to further escalate privileges. | new | 1

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-potential-sudo-hijacking-detected, Potential Sudo Hijacking Detected>> | Identifies the creation of a sudo binary located at /usr/bin/sudo. Attackers may hijack the default sudo binary and replace it with a custom binary or script that can read the user's password in clear text to escalate privileges or enable persistence onto the system every time the sudo binary is executed. | new | 1

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-potential-sudo-token-manipulation-via-process-injection, Potential Sudo Token Manipulation via Process Injection>> | This rule detects potential sudo token manipulation attacks through process injection by monitoring the use of a debugger (gdb) process followed by a successful uid change event during the execution of the sudo process. A sudo token manipulation attack is performed by injecting into a process that has a valid sudo token, which can then be used by attackers to activate their own sudo token. This attack requires ptrace to be enabled in conjunction with the existence of a living process that has a valid sudo token with the same uid as the current user. | new | 1

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-suspicious-network-activity-to-the-internet-by-previously-unknown-executable, Suspicious Network Activity to the Internet by Previously Unknown Executable>> | This rule monitors for network connectivity to the internet from a previously unknown executable located in a suspicious directory to a previously unknown destination ip. An alert from this rule can indicate the presence of potentially malicious activity, such as the execution of unauthorized or suspicious processes attempting to establish connections to unknown or suspicious destinations such as a command and control server. Detecting and investigating such behavior can help identify and mitigate potential security threats, protecting the system and its data from potential compromise. | update | 2

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-enumeration-of-kernel-modules, Enumeration of Kernel Modules>> | Loadable Kernel Modules (or LKMs) are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. This identifies attempts to enumerate information about a kernel module. | update | 204

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-enumeration-of-kernel-modules-via-proc, Enumeration of Kernel Modules via Proc>> | Loadable Kernel Modules (or LKMs) are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. This identifies attempts to enumerate information about a kernel module using the /proc/modules filesystem. This filesystem is used by utilities such as lsmod and kmod to list the available kernel modules. | update | 2

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-suspicious-modprobe-file-event, Suspicious Modprobe File Event>> | Detects file events involving kernel modules in modprobe configuration files, which may indicate unauthorized access or manipulation of critical kernel modules. Attackers may tamper with the modprobe files to load malicious or unauthorized kernel modules, potentially bypassing security measures, escalating privileges, or hiding their activities within the system. | update | 2

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-suspicious-sysctl-file-event, Suspicious Sysctl File Event>> | Monitors file events on sysctl configuration files (e.g., /etc/sysctl.conf, /etc/sysctl.d/*.conf) to identify potential unauthorized access or manipulation of system-level configuration settings. Attackers may tamper with the sysctl configuration files to modify kernel parameters, potentially compromising system stability, performance, or security. | update | 2

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-suspicious-proc-pseudo-file-system-enumeration, Suspicious Proc Pseudo File System Enumeration>> | This rule monitors for a rapid enumeration of 25 different proc cmd, stat, and exe files, which suggests an abnormal activity pattern. Such behavior could be an indicator of a malicious process scanning or gathering information about running processes, potentially for reconnaissance, privilege escalation, or identifying vulnerable targets. | update | 2

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-abnormal-process-id-or-lock-file-created, Abnormal Process ID or Lock File Created>> | Identifies the creation of a Process ID (PID), lock or reboot file created in temporary file storage paradigm (tmpfs) directory /var/run. On Linux, the PID files typically hold the process ID to track previous copies running and manage other tasks. Certain Linux malware use the /var/run directory for holding data, executables and other tasks, disguising itself or these files as legitimate PID files. | update | 208

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-potential-code-execution-via-postgresql, Potential Code Execution via Postgresql>> | This rule monitors for suspicious activities that may indicate an attacker attempting to execute arbitrary code within a PostgreSQL environment. Attackers can execute code via PostgreSQL as a result of gaining unauthorized access to a public facing PostgreSQL database or exploiting vulnerabilities, such as remote command execution and SQL injection attacks, which can result in unauthorized access and malicious actions, and facilitate post-exploitation activities for unauthorized access and malicious actions. | update | 2

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-linux-restricted-shell-breakout-via-linux-binary-s, Linux Restricted Shell Breakout via Linux Binary(s)>> | Identifies the abuse of a Linux binary to break out of a restricted shell or environment by spawning an interactive system shell. The activity of spawning a shell from a binary is not common behavior for a user or system administrator, and may indicate an attempt to evade detection, increase capabilities or enhance the stability of an adversary. | update | 107

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-potential-reverse-shell-via-suspicious-parent-process, Potential Reverse Shell via Suspicious Parent Process>> | This detection rule detects the creation of a shell through a suspicious parent child relationship. Any reverse shells spawned by the specified utilities that use a forked process to initialize the connection attempt will be captured through this rule. Attackers may spawn reverse shells to establish persistence onto a target system. | update | 3

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-potential-reverse-shell-via-suspicious-child-process, Potential Reverse Shell via Suspicious Child Process>> | This detection rule detects the creation of a shell through a suspicious process chain. Any reverse shells spawned by the specified utilities that are initialized from a single process followed by a network connection attempt will be captured through this rule. Attackers may spawn reverse shells to establish persistence onto a target system. | update | 3

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-potential-reverse-shell-via-suspicious-binary, Potential Reverse Shell via Suspicious Binary>> | This detection rule detects the creation of a shell through a chain consisting of the execution of a suspicious binary (located in a commonly abused location or executed manually) followed by a network event and ending with a shell being spawned. Stageless reverse tcp shells display this behaviour. Attackers may spawn reverse shells to establish persistence onto a target system. | update | 3

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-potential-reverse-shell, Potential Reverse Shell>> | This detection rule identifies suspicious network traffic patterns associated with TCP reverse shell activity. This activity consists of a parent-child relationship where a network event is followed by the creation of a shell process. An attacker may establish a Linux TCP reverse shell to gain remote access to a target system. | update | 3

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-suspicious-file-changes-activity-detected, Suspicious File Changes Activity Detected>> | This rule identifies a sequence of 100 file extension rename events within a set of common file paths by the same process in a timespan of 1 second. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files or systems and demands payment (usually in cryptocurrency) in exchange for the decryption key. One important indicator of a ransomware attack is the mass encryption of the file system, after which a new file extension is added to the file. | update | 4

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-potential-linux-ransomware-note-creation-detected, Potential Linux Ransomware Note Creation Detected>> | This rule identifies a sequence of a mass file encryption event in conjunction with the creation of a .txt file with a file name containing ransomware keywords executed by the same process in a 1 second timespan. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files or systems and demands payment (usually in cryptocurrency) in exchange for the decryption key. One important indicator of a ransomware attack is the mass encryption of the file system, after which a new file extension is added to the file. | update | 4

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-cron-job-created-or-changed-by-previously-unknown-process, Cron Job Created or Changed by Previously Unknown Process>> | Linux cron jobs are scheduled tasks that can be leveraged by malicious actors for persistence, privilege escalation and command execution. By creating or modifying cron job configurations, attackers can execute malicious commands or scripts at predefined intervals, ensuring their continued presence and enabling unauthorized activities. | update | 3

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-potential-persistence-through-init-d-detected, Potential Persistence Through init.d Detected>> | Files that are placed in the /etc/init.d/ directory in Unix can be used to start custom applications, services, scripts or commands during start-up. Init.d has been mostly replaced in favor of Systemd. However, the "systemd-sysv-generator" can convert init.d files to service unit files that run at boot. Adversaries may add or alter files located in the /etc/init.d/ directory to execute malicious code upon boot in order to gain persistence on the system. | update | 4

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-potential-persistence-through-motd-file-creation-detected, Potential Persistence Through MOTD File Creation Detected>> | Message of the day (MOTD) is the message that is presented to the user when a user connects to a Linux server via SSH or a serial connection. Linux systems contain several default MOTD files located in the "/etc/update-motd.d/" and "/usr/lib/update-notifier/" directories. These scripts run as the root user every time a user connects over SSH or a serial connection. Adversaries may create malicious MOTD files that grant them persistence onto the target every time a user connects to the system by executing a backdoor script or command. This rule detects the creation of potentially malicious files within the default MOTD file directories. | update | 4

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-suspicious-process-spawned-from-motd-detected, Suspicious Process Spawned from MOTD Detected>> | Message of the day (MOTD) is the message that is presented to the user when a user connects to a Linux server via SSH or a serial connection. Linux systems contain several default MOTD files located in the "/etc/update-motd.d/" and "/usr/lib/update-notifier/" directories. These scripts run as the root user every time a user connects over SSH or a serial connection. Adversaries may create malicious MOTD files that grant them persistence onto the target every time a user connects to the system by executing a backdoor script or command. This rule detects the execution of potentially malicious processes through the MOTD utility. | update | 4

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-potential-persistence-through-run-control-detected, Potential Persistence Through Run Control Detected>> | This rule monitors the creation/alteration of the rc.local file by a previously unknown process executable through the use of the new terms rule type. The /etc/rc.local file is used to start custom applications, services, scripts or commands during start-up. The rc.local file has mostly been replaced by Systemd. However, through the "systemd-rc-local-generator", rc.local files can be converted to services that run at boot. Adversaries may alter rc.local to execute malicious code at start-up, and gain persistence onto the system. | update | 105

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-shared-object-created-or-changed-by-previously-unknown-process, Shared Object Created or Changed by Previously Unknown Process>> | This rule monitors the creation of shared object files by previously unknown processes. The creation of a shared object file involves compiling code into a dynamically linked library that can be loaded by other programs at runtime. While this process is typically used for legitimate purposes, malicious actors can leverage shared object files to execute unauthorized code, inject malicious functionality into legitimate processes, or bypass security controls. This allows malware to persist on the system, evade detection, and potentially compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the affected system and its data. | update | 2

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-new-systemd-timer-created, New Systemd Timer Created>> | Detects the creation of a systemd timer within any of the default systemd timer directories. Systemd timers can be used by an attacker to gain persistence, by scheduling the execution of a command or script. Similarly to cron/at, systemd timers can be set up to execute on boot time, or on a specific point in time, which allows attackers to regain access in case the connection to the infected asset was lost. | update | 4

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-new-systemd-service-created-by-previously-unknown-process, New Systemd Service Created by Previously Unknown Process>> | Systemd service files are configuration files in Linux systems used to define and manage system services. Malicious actors can leverage systemd service files to achieve persistence by creating or modifying service files to execute malicious commands or payloads during system startup. This allows them to maintain unauthorized access, execute additional malicious activities, or evade detection. | update | 3

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-kernel-load-or-unload-via-kexec-detected, Kernel Load or Unload via Kexec Detected>> | This detection rule identifies the usage of kexec, helping to uncover unauthorized kernel replacements and potential compromise of the system's integrity. Kexec is a Linux feature that enables the loading and execution of a different kernel without going through the typical boot process. Malicious actors can abuse kexec to bypass security measures, escalate privileges, establish persistence or hide their activities by loading a malicious kernel, enabling them to tamper with the system's trusted state, allowing e.g. a VM Escape. | update | 2

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-potential-network-sweep-detected, Potential Network Sweep Detected>> | This rule identifies a potential network sweep.  A network sweep is a method used by attackers to scan a target network, identifying active hosts, open ports, and available services to gather information on vulnerabilities and weaknesses. This reconnaissance helps them plan subsequent attacks and exploit potential entry points for unauthorized access, data theft, or other malicious activities. This rule proposes threshold logic to check for connection attempts from one source host to 10 or more destination hosts on commonly used network services. | update | 2

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-potential-network-scan-detected, Potential Network Scan Detected>> | This rule identifies a potential port scan. A port scan is a method utilized by attackers to systematically scan a target system or network for open ports, allowing them to identify available services and potential vulnerabilities. By mapping out the open ports, attackers can gather critical information to plan and execute targeted attacks, gaining unauthorized access, compromising security, and potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized control, or further exploitation of the targeted system or network. This rule proposes threshold logic to check for connection attempts from one source host to 20 or more destination ports. | update | 2

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-potential-syn-based-network-scan-detected, Potential SYN-Based Network Scan Detected>> | This rule identifies a potential SYN-Based port scan. A SYN port scan is a technique employed by attackers to scan a target network for open ports by sending SYN packets to multiple ports and observing the response. Attackers use this method to identify potential entry points or services that may be vulnerable to exploitation, allowing them to launch targeted attacks or gain unauthorized access to the system or network, compromising its security and potentially leading to data breaches or further malicious activities. This rule proposes threshold logic to check for connection attempts from one source host to 10 or more destination ports using 2 or less packets per port. | update | 2

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-startup-or-run-key-registry-modification, Startup or Run Key Registry Modification>> | Identifies run key or startup key registry modifications. In order to survive reboots and other system interrupts, attackers will modify run keys within the registry or leverage startup folder items as a form of persistence. | update | 108

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-8-9-suspicious-service-was-installed-in-the-system, Suspicious Service was Installed in the System>> | Identifies the creation of a new Windows service with suspicious Service command values. Windows services typically run as SYSTEM and can be used for privilege escalation and persistence. | update | 8
