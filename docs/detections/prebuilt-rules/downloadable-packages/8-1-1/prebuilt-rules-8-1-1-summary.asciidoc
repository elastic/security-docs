[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
|Rule |Description |Status |Version

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-1-1-elastic-agent-service-terminated, Elastic Agent Service Terminated>> | Identifies the Elastic endpoint agent has stopped and is no longer running on the host. Adversaries may attempt to disable security monitoring tools in an attempt to evade detection or prevention capabilities during an intrusion. This may also indicate an issue with the agent itself and should be addressed to ensure defensive measures are back in a stable state. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-1-1-aws-redshift-cluster-creation, AWS Redshift Cluster Creation>> | Identifies the creation of an Amazon Redshift cluster. Unexpected creation of this cluster by a non-administrative user may indicate a permission or role issue with current users. If unexpected, the resource may not properly be configured and could introduce security vulnerabilities. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-1-1-kubernetes-user-exec-into-pod, Kubernetes User Exec into Pod>> | This rule detects a user attempt to establish a shell session into a pod using the 'exec' command. Using the 'exec' command in a pod allows a user to establish a temporary shell session and execute any process/commands in the pod. An adversary may call bash to gain a persistent interactive shell which will allow access to any data the pod has permissions to, including secrets. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-1-1-suspicious-network-connection-attempt-by-root, Suspicious Network Connection Attempt by Root>> | Identifies an outbound network connection attempt followed by a session id change as the root user by the same process entity. This particular instantiation of a network connection is abnormal and should be investigated as it may indicate a potential reverse shell activity via a privileged process. | new | 1

On Linux, the PID files typically hold the process ID to track previous copies running and manage other tasks. Certain Linux malware use the /var/run directory for holding data, executables and other tasks, disguising itself or these files as legitimate PID files. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-1-1-process-started-from-process-id-pid-file, Process Started from Process ID (PID) File>> | Identifies a new process starting from a process ID (PID), lock or reboot file within the temporary file storage paradigm (tmpfs) directory /var/run directory. On Linux, the PID files typically hold the process ID to track previous copies running and manage other tasks. Certain Linux malware use the /var/run directory for holding data, executables and other tasks, disguising itself or these files as legitimate PID files. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-1-1-binary-executed-from-shared-memory-directory, Binary Executed from Shared Memory Directory>> | Identifies the execution of a binary by root in Linux shared memory directories: (/dev/shm/, /run/shm/, /var/run/, /var/lock/).

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-1-1-unusual-linux-username, Unusual Linux Username>> | A machine learning job detected activity for a username that is not normally active, which can indicate unauthorized changes, activity by unauthorized users, lateral movement, or compromised credentials. In many organizations, new usernames are not often created apart from specific types of system activities, such as creating new accounts for new employees. These user accounts quickly become active and routine. Events from rarely used usernames can point to suspicious activity. Additionally, automated Linux fleets tend to see activity from rarely used usernames only when personnel log in to make authorized or unauthorized changes, or threat actors have acquired credentials and log in for malicious purposes. Unusual usernames can also indicate pivoting, where compromised credentials are used to try and move laterally from one host to another. | update | 8 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-1-1-unusual-linux-system-information-discovery-activity, Unusual Linux System Information Discovery Activity>> | Looks for commands related to system information discovery from an unusual user context.

In many organizations, new usernames are not often created apart from specific types of system activities, such as creating new accounts for new employees. These user accounts quickly become active and routine. Events from rarely used usernames can point to suspicious activity. Additionally, automated Linux fleets tend to see activity from rarely used usernames only when personnel log in to make authorized or unauthorized changes, or threat actors have acquired credentials and log in for malicious purposes. Unusual usernames can also indicate pivoting, where compromised credentials are used to try and move laterally from one host to another. | update | 8 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-1-1-unusual-windows-user-privilege-elevation-activity, Unusual Windows User Privilege Elevation Activity>> | A machine learning job detected an unusual user context switch, using the runas command or similar techniques, which can indicate account takeover or privilege escalation using compromised accounts. Privilege elevation using tools like runas are more commonly used by domain and network administrators than by regular Windows users. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-1-1-unusual-windows-remote-user, Unusual Windows Remote User>> | A machine learning job detected an unusual remote desktop protocol (RDP) username, which can indicate account takeover or credentialed persistence using compromised accounts. RDP attacks, such as BlueKeep, also tend to use unusual usernames. | update | 6 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-1-1-rdp-remote-desktop-protocol-from-the-internet, RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) from the Internet>> | This rule detects network events that may indicate the use of RDP traffic from the Internet. RDP is commonly used by system administrators to remotely control a system for maintenance or to use shared resources. It should almost never be directly exposed to the Internet, as it is frequently targeted and exploited by threat actors as an initial access or backdoor vector. | update | 14 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-1-1-telnet-port-activity, Telnet Port Activity>> | This rule detects network events that may indicate the use of Telnet traffic. Telnet is commonly used by system administrators to remotely control older or embedded systems using the command line shell.
