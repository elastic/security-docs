## Triage and analysis

### Investigating Unusual File Write
Detection alerts from this rule indicate potential unusual/abnormal file writes from the DNS Server service process (`dns.exe`) after exploitation from CVE-2020-1350 (SigRed) has occurred. Here are some possible avenues of investigation:
- Post-exploitation, adversaries may write additional files or payloads to the system as additional discovery/exploitation/persistence mechanisms.
- Any suspicious or abnormal files written from `dns.exe` should be reviewed and investigated with care.
