----------------------------------
This is a test alert.

This alert does not show threat activity. Elastic created this alert to help you understand how alerts work.

For normal rules, the Investigation Guide will help analysts investigate alerts.

This alert will show once every 24 hours for each host. It is safe to disable this rule.
