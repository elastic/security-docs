|==============================================
|Rule |Description |Status |Version

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-2-google-drive-ownership-transferred-via-google-workspace, Google Drive Ownership Transferred via Google Workspace>> | Drive and Docs is a Google Workspace service that allows users to leverage Google Drive and Google Docs. Access to files is based on inherited permissions from the child organizational unit the user belongs to which is scoped by administrators. Typically if a user is removed, their files can be transferred to another user by the administrator. This service can also be abused by adversaries to transfer files to an adversary account for potential exfiltration. | new | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-2-google-workspace-custom-gmail-route-created-or-modified, Google Workspace Custom Gmail Route Created or Modified>> | Detects when a custom Gmail route is added or modified in Google Workspace. Adversaries can add a custom e-mail route for outbound mail to route these e-mails to their own inbox of choice for data gathering. This allows adversaries to capture sensitive information from e-mail and potential attachments, such as invoices or payment documents. By default, all email from current Google Workspace users with accounts are routed through a domain's mail server for inbound and outbound mail. | new | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-2-application-removed-from-blocklist-in-google-workspace, Application Removed from Blocklist in Google Workspace>> | Google Workspace administrators may be aware of malicious applications within the Google marketplace and block these applications for user security purposes. An adversary, with administrative privileges, may remove this application from the explicit block list to allow distribution of the application amongst users. This may also indicate the unauthorized use of an application that had been previously blocked before by a user with admin privileges. | new | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-2-google-workspace-bitlocker-setting-disabled, Google Workspace Bitlocker Setting Disabled>> | Google Workspace administrators whom manage Windows devices and have Windows device management enabled may also enable BitLocker drive encryption to mitigate unauthorized data access on lost or stolen computers.

The security label is only applied to a group when users within that group are expected to access sensitive data and/or resources so administrators add this label to easily manage security groups better. Adversaries with administrator access may modify a security group to allow external access from members outside the organization. This detection does not capture all modifications to security groups, but only those that could increase the risk associated with them. | new | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-2-google-workspace-user-organizational-unit-changed, Google Workspace User Organizational Unit Changed>> | Users in Google Workspace are typically assigned a specific organizational unit that grants them permissions to certain services and roles that are inherited from this organizational unit. Adversaries may compromise a valid account and change which organizational account the user belongs to which then could allow them to inherit permissions to applications and resources inaccessible prior to. | new | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-2-potential-ssh-password-guessing, Potential SSH Password Guessing>> | Identifies multiple SSH login failures followed by a successful one from the same source address.
