=== First Time AWS Cloudformation Stack Creation by User

This rule detects the first time a principal calls AWS Cloudwatch `CreateStack` or `CreateStackSet` API. Cloudformation is used to create a single collection of cloud resources called a stack, via a defined template file. An attacker with the appropriate privileges could leverage Cloudformation to create specific resources needed to further exploit the environment. This is a new terms rule that looks for the first instance of this behavior in the last 10 days for a role or IAM user within a particular account.
