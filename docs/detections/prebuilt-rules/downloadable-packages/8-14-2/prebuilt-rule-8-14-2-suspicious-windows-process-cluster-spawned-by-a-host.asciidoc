=== Suspicious Windows Process Cluster Spawned by a Host

A machine learning job combination has detected a set of one or more suspicious Windows processes with unusually high scores for malicious probability. These process(es) have been classified as malicious in several ways. The process(es) were predicted to be malicious by the ProblemChild supervised ML model. If the anomaly contains a cluster of suspicious processes, each process has the same host name, and the aggregate score of the event cluster was calculated to be unusually high by an unsupervised ML model. Such a cluster often contains suspicious or malicious activity, possibly involving LOLbins, that may be resistant to detection using conventional search rules.

==== Setup



*Setup*


The rule requires the Living off the Land (LotL) Attack Detection integration assets to be installed, as well as Windows process events collected by integrations such as Elastic Defend or Winlogbeat.  


*LotL Attack Detection Setup*

The LotL Attack Detection integration detects living-off-the-land activity in Windows process events.


*Prerequisite Requirements:*

- Fleet is required for LotL Attack Detection.
- To configure Fleet Server refer to the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-server.html[documentation].
- Windows process events collected by the https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/endpoint[Elastic Defend] integration or Winlogbeat(https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/current/_winlogbeat_overview.html).
- To install Elastic Defend, refer to the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/install-endpoint.html[documentation].
- To set up and run Winlogbeat, follow https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/current/winlogbeat-installation-configuration.html[this] guide.


*The following steps should be executed to install assets associated with the LotL Attack Detection integration:*

- Go to the Kibana homepage. Under Management, click Integrations.
- In the query bar, search for Living off the Land Attack Detection and select the integration to see more details about it.
- Follow the instructions under the **Installation** section.
- For this rule to work, complete the instructions through **Add preconfigured anomaly detection jobs**.
