|<<prebuilt-rule-0-14-1-unusual-linux-network-activity, Unusual Linux Network Activity>> | Identifies Linux processes that do not usually use the network but have unexpected network activity, which can indicate command-and-control, lateral movement, persistence, or data exfiltration activity. A process with unusual network activity can denote process exploitation or injection, where the process is used to run persistence mechanisms that allow a malicious actor remote access or control of the host, data exfiltration, and execution of unauthorized network applications. | update | 6 

|<<prebuilt-rule-0-14-1-anomalous-process-for-a-linux-population, Anomalous Process For a Linux Population>> | Searches for rare processes running on multiple Linux hosts in an entire fleet or network. This reduces the detection of false positives since automated maintenance processes usually only run occasionally on a single machine but are common to all or many hosts in a fleet. | update | 7 

|<<prebuilt-rule-0-14-1-unusual-linux-username, Unusual Linux Username>> | A machine learning job detected activity for a username that is not normally active, which can indicate unauthorized changes, activity by unauthorized users, lateral movement, or compromised credentials. In many organizations, new usernames are not often created apart from specific types of system activities, such as creating new accounts for new employees. These user accounts quickly become active and routine. Events from rarely used usernames can point to suspicious activity. Additionally, automated Linux fleets tend to see activity from rarely used usernames only when personnel log in to make authorized or unauthorized changes, or threat actors have acquired credentials and log in for malicious purposes. Unusual usernames can also indicate pivoting, where compromised credentials are used to try and move laterally from one host to another. | update | 7 

|<<prebuilt-rule-0-14-1-unusual-process-for-a-linux-host, Unusual Process For a Linux Host>> | Identifies rare processes that do not usually run on individual hosts, which can indicate execution of unauthorized services, malware, or persistence mechanisms.

See the References section for additional information on module configuration. | update | 6 

|<<prebuilt-rule-0-14-1-dns-activity-to-the-internet, DNS Activity to the Internet>> | This rule detects when an internal network client sends DNS traffic directly to the Internet. This is atypical behavior for a managed network and can be indicative of malware, exfiltration, command and control, or simply misconfiguration. This DNS activity also impacts your organization's ability to provide enterprise monitoring and logging of DNS and it opens your network to a variety of abuses and malicious communications. | update | 11 

|<<prebuilt-rule-0-14-1-roshal-archive-rar-or-powershell-file-downloaded-from-the-internet, Roshal Archive (RAR) or PowerShell File Downloaded from the Internet>> | Detects a Roshal Archive (RAR) file or PowerShell script downloaded from the internet by an internal host. Gaining initial access to a system and then downloading encoded or encrypted tools to move laterally is a common practice for adversaries as a way to protect their more valuable tools and TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures). This may be atypical behavior for a managed network and can be indicative of malware, exfiltration, or command and control. | update | 7 

|<<prebuilt-rule-0-14-1-rdp-remote-desktop-protocol-from-the-internet, RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) from the Internet>> | This rule detects network events that may indicate the use of RDP traffic from the Internet.

It should almost never be directly exposed to the Internet, as it is frequently targeted and exploited by threat actors as an initial access or backdoor vector. | update | 11 

|<<prebuilt-rule-0-14-1-rpc-remote-procedure-call-to-the-internet, RPC (Remote Procedure Call) to the Internet>> | This rule detects network events that may indicate the use of RPC traffic to the Internet. RPC is commonly used by system administrators to remotely control a system for maintenance or to use shared resources. It should almost never be directly exposed to the Internet, as it is frequently targeted and exploited by threat actors as an initial access or backdoor vector. | update | 11 

|<<prebuilt-rule-0-14-1-smb-windows-file-sharing-activity-to-the-internet, SMB (Windows File Sharing) Activity to the Internet>> | This rule detects network events that may indicate the use of Windows file sharing (also called SMB or CIFS) traffic to the Internet. SMB is commonly used within networks to share files, printers, and other system resources amongst trusted systems. It should almost never be directly exposed to the Internet, as it is frequently targeted and exploited by threat actors as an initial access or backdoor vector or for data exfiltration. | update | 11 

|<<prebuilt-rule-0-14-1-exporting-exchange-mailbox-via-powershell, Exporting Exchange Mailbox via PowerShell>> | Identifies the use of the Exchange PowerShell cmdlet, New-MailBoxExportRequest, to export the contents of a primary mailbox or archive to a .pst file.
