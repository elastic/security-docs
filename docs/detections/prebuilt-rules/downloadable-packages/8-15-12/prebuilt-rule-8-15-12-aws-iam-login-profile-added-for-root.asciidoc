=== AWS IAM Login Profile Added for Root

Detects when an AWS IAM login profile is added to a root user account and is self-assigned. Adversaries, with temporary access to the root account, may add a login profile to the root user account to maintain access even if the original access key is rotated or disabled.

==== Investigation guide



*Investigating AWS IAM Login Profile Added for Root*


This rule detects when a login profile is added to the AWS root account. Adding a login profile to the root account, especially if self-assigned, is highly suspicious as it might indicate an adversary trying to establish persistence in the environment.


*Possible Investigation Steps*


- **Identify the Source and Context of the Action**:
    - Examine the `source.address` field to identify the IP address from which the request originated.
        - Check the geographic location (`source.address`) to determine if the access is from an expected or unexpected region.
    - Look at the `user_agent.original` field to identify the tool or browser used for this action.
        - For example, a user agent like `Mozilla/5.0` might indicate interactive access, whereas `aws-cli` or SDKs suggest scripted activity.

- **Confirm Root User and Request Details**:
    - Validate the root user's identity through `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` and ensure this activity aligns with legitimate administrative actions.
    - Review `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` to identify if the action was performed using temporary or permanent credentials. This access key could be used to pivot into other actions.

- **Analyze the Login Profile Creation**:
    - Review the `aws.cloudtrail.request_parameters` and `aws.cloudtrail.response_elements` fields for details of the created login profile.
        - For example, confirm the `userName` of the profile and whether `passwordResetRequired` is set to `true`.
    - Compare the `@timestamp` of this event with other recent actions by the root account to identify potential privilege escalation or abuse.

- **Correlate with Other Events**:
    - Investigate for related IAM activities, such as:
        - `CreateAccessKey` or `AttachUserPolicy` events targeting the root account.
        - Unusual data access, privilege escalation, or management console logins.
    - Check for any anomalies involving the same `source.address` or `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` in the environment.

- **Evaluate Policy and Permissions**:
    - Verify the current security policies for the root account:
        - Ensure password policies enforce complexity and rotation requirements.
        - Check if MFA is enforced on the root account.
    - Assess the broader IAM configuration for deviations from least privilege principles.


*False Positive Analysis*


- **Routine Administrative Tasks**: Adding a login profile might be a legitimate action during certain administrative processes. Verify with the relevant AWS administrators if this event aligns with routine account maintenance or emergency recovery scenarios.

- **Automation**: If the action is part of an approved automation process (e.g., account recovery workflows), consider excluding these activities from alerting using specific user agents, IP addresses, or session attributes.


*Response and Remediation*


- **Immediate Access Review**:
    - Disable the newly created login profile (`aws iam delete-login-profile`) if it is determined to be unauthorized.
    - Rotate or disable the credentials associated with the root account to prevent further abuse.

- **Enhance Monitoring and Alerts**:
    - Enable real-time monitoring and alerting for IAM actions involving the root account.
    - Increase the logging verbosity for root account activities.

- **Review and Update Security Policies**:
    - Enforce MFA for all administrative actions, including root account usage.
    - Restrict programmatic access to the root account by disabling access keys unless absolutely necessary.

- **Conduct Post-Incident Analysis**:
    - Investigate how the credentials for the root account were compromised or misused.
    - Strengthen the security posture by implementing account-specific guardrails and continuous monitoring.
