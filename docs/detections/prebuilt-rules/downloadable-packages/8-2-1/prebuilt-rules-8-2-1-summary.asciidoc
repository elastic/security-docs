|<<prebuilt-rule-8-2-1-kubernetes-suspicious-self-subject-review, Kubernetes Suspicious Self-Subject Review>> | This rule detects when a service account or node attempts to enumerate their own permissions via the selfsubjectaccessreview or selfsubjectrulesreview APIs. This is highly unusual behavior for non-human identities like service accounts and nodes. An adversary may have gained access to credentials/tokens and this could be an attempt to determine what privileges they have to facilitate further movement or execution within the cluster. | new | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-2-1-kubernetes-user-exec-into-pod, Kubernetes User Exec into Pod>> | This rule detects a user attempt to establish a shell session into a pod using the 'exec' command. Using the 'exec' command in a pod allows a user to establish a temporary shell session and execute any process/commands in the pod. An adversary may call bash to gain a persistent interactive shell which will allow access to any data the pod has permissions to, including secrets. | new | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-2-1-kubernetes-exposed-service-created-with-type-nodeport, Kubernetes Exposed Service Created With Type NodePort>> | This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a service as type NodePort. The NodePort service allows a user to externally expose a set of labeled pods to the internet. This creates an open port on every worker node in the cluster that has a pod for that service. When external traffic is received on that open port, it directs it to the specific pod through the service representing it. A malicious user can configure a service as type Nodeport in order to intercept traffic from other pods or nodes, bypassing firewalls and other network security measures configured for load balancers within a cluster. This creates a direct method of communication between the cluster and the outside world, which could be used for more malicious behavior and certainly widens the attack surface of your cluster. | new | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-2-1-kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostipc, Kubernetes Pod Created With HostIPC>> | This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a pod using the host IPC namespace. This gives access to data used by any pod that also use the host�s IPC namespace. If any process on the host or any processes in a pod uses the host�s inter-process communication mechanisms (shared memory, semaphore arrays, message queues, etc.), an attacker can read/write to those same mechanisms. They may look for files in /dev/shm or use ipcs to check for any IPC facilities being used. | new | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-2-1-kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostnetwork, Kubernetes Pod Created With HostNetwork>> | This rules detects an attempt to create or modify a pod attached to the host network. HostNetwork allows a pod to use the node network namespace. Doing so gives the pod access to any service running on localhost of the host. An attacker could use this access to snoop on network activity of other pods on the same node or bypass restrictive network policies applied to its given namespace. | new | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-2-1-kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostpid, Kubernetes Pod Created With HostPID>> | This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a pod attached to the host PID namespace. HostPID allows a pod to access all the processes running on the host and could allow an attacker to take malicious action. When paired with ptrace this can be used to escalate privileges outside of the container. When paired with a privileged container, the pod can see all of the processes on the host. An attacker can enter the init system (PID 1) on the host. From there, they could execute a shell and continue to escalate privileges to root. | new | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-2-1-kubernetes-pod-created-with-a-sensitive-hostpath-volume, Kubernetes Pod created with a Sensitive hostPath Volume>> | This rule detects when a pod is created with a sensitive volume of type hostPath. A hostPath volume type mounts a sensitive file or folder from the node to the container. If the container gets compromised, the attacker can use this mount for gaining access to the node. There are many ways a container with unrestricted access to the host filesystem can escalate privileges, including reading data from other containers, and accessing tokens of more privileged pods. | new | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-2-1-kubernetes-privileged-pod-created, Kubernetes Privileged Pod Created>> | This rule detects when a user creates a pod/container running in privileged mode. A highly privileged container has access to the node's resources and breaks the isolation between containers. If compromised, an attacker can use the privileged container to gain access to the underlying host. Gaining access to the host may provide the adversary with the opportunity to achieve follow-on objectives, such as establishing persistence, moving laterally within the environment, or setting up a command and control channel on the host. | new | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-2-1-microsoft-365-inbox-forwarding-rule-created, Microsoft 365 Inbox Forwarding Rule Created>> | Identifies when a new Inbox forwarding rule is created in Microsoft 365.

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-2-1-o365-mailbox-audit-logging-bypass, O365 Mailbox Audit Logging Bypass>> | Detects the occurrence of mailbox audit bypass associations. The mailbox audit is responsible for logging specified mailbox events (like accessing a folder or a message or permanently deleting a message). However, actions taken by some authorized accounts, such as accounts used by third-party tools or accounts used for lawful monitoring, can create a large number of mailbox audit log entries and may not be of interest to your organization. Because of this, administrators can create bypass associations, allowing certain accounts to perform their tasks without being logged. Attackers can abuse this allowlist mechanism to conceal actions taken, as the mailbox audit will log no activity done by the account. | new | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-2-1-microsoft-365-exchange-transport-rule-creation, Microsoft 365 Exchange Transport Rule Creation>> | Identifies a transport rule creation in Microsoft 365.

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-2-1-unusual-dns-activity, Unusual DNS Activity>> | A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual DNS query that indicate network activity with unusual DNS domains. This can be due to initial access, persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, when a user clicks on a link in a phishing email or opens a malicious document, a request may be sent to download and run a payload from an uncommon domain. When malware is already running, it may send requests to an uncommon DNS domain the malware uses for command-and-control communication. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-2-1-unusual-web-request, Unusual Web Request>> | A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual URL that indicates unusual web browsing activity. This can be due to initial access, persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, in a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack, when a trusted website is compromised to target a particular sector or organization, targeted users may receive emails with uncommon URLs for trusted websites. These URLs can be used to download and run a payload. When malware is already running, it may send requests to uncommon URLs on trusted websites the malware uses for command-and-control communication. When rare URLs are observed being requested for a local web server by a remote source, these can be due to web scanning, enumeration or attack traffic, or they can be due to bots and web scrapers which are part of common Internet background traffic. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-2-1-unusual-web-user-agent, Unusual Web User Agent>> | A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual user agent indicating web browsing activity by an unusual process other than a web browser. This can be due to persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. Uncommon user agents coming from remote sources to local destinations are often the result of scanners, bots, and web scrapers, which are part of common Internet background traffic. Much of this is noise, but more targeted attacks on websites using tools like Burp or SQLmap can sometimes be discovered by spotting uncommon user agents. Uncommon user agents in traffic from local sources to remote destinations can be any number of things, including harmless programs like weather monitoring or stock-trading programs. However, uncommon user agents from local sources can also be due to malware or scanning activity. | update | 5
