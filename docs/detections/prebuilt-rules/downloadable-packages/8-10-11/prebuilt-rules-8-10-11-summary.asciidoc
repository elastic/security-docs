[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
|Rule |Description |Status |Version

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-10-11-executable-masquerading-as-kernel-process, Executable Masquerading as Kernel Process>> | Monitors for kernel processes with associated process executable fields that are not empty. Unix kernel processes such as kthreadd and kworker typically do not have process.executable fields associated to them. Attackers may attempt to hide their malicious programs by masquerading as legitimate kernel processes. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-10-11-suspicious-dynamic-linker-discovery-via-od, Suspicious Dynamic Linker Discovery via od>> | Monitors for dynamic linker discovery via the od utility. od (octal dump) is a command-line utility in Unix operating systems used for displaying data in various formats, including octal, hexadecimal, decimal, and ASCII, primarily used for examining and debugging binary files or data streams. Attackers can leverage od to analyze the dynamic linker by identifying injection points and craft exploits based on the observed behaviors and structures within these files. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-10-11-suspicious-proc-maps-discovery, Suspicious /proc/maps Discovery>> | Monitors for /proc/*/maps file reads. The /proc/*/maps file in Linux provides a memory map for a specific process, detailing the memory segments, permissions, and what files are mapped to these segments. Attackers may read a process's memory map to identify memory addresses for code injection or process hijacking. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-10-11-suspicious-apt-package-manager-execution, Suspicious APT Package Manager Execution>> | Detects suspicious process events executed by the APT package manager, potentially indicating persistence through an APT backdoor. In Linux, APT (Advanced Package Tool) is a command-line utility used for handling packages on Debian-based systems, providing functions for installing, updating, upgrading, and removing software along with managing package repositories. Attackers can backdoor APT to gain persistence by injecting malicious code into scripts that APT runs, thereby ensuring continued unauthorized access or control each time APT is used for package management. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-10-11-suspicious-apt-package-manager-network-connection, Suspicious APT Package Manager Network Connection>> | Detects suspicious network events executed by the APT package manager, potentially indicating persistence through an APT backdoor. In Linux, APT (Advanced Package Tool) is a command-line utility used for handling packages on Debian-based systems, providing functions for installing, updating, upgrading, and removing software along with managing package repositories. Attackers can backdoor APT to gain persistence by injecting malicious code into scripts that APT runs, thereby ensuring continued unauthorized access or control each time APT is used for package management. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-10-11-suspicious-network-connection-via-systemd, Suspicious Network Connection via systemd>> | Detects suspicious network events executed by systemd, potentially indicating persistence through a systemd backdoor. Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems, used to initialize and manage system processes. Attackers can backdoor systemd for persistence by creating or modifying systemd unit files to execute malicious scripts or commands, or by replacing legitimate systemd binaries with compromised ones, ensuring that their malicious code is automatically executed at system startup or during certain system events. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-10-11-suspicious-passwd-file-event-action, Suspicious Passwd File Event Action>> | Monitors for the generation of a passwd password entry via openssl, followed by a file write activity on the "/etc/passwd" file. The "/etc/passwd" file in Linux stores user account information, including usernames, user IDs, group IDs, home directories, and default shell paths. Attackers may exploit a misconfiguration in the "/etc/passwd" file permissions or other privileges to add a new entry to the "/etc/passwd" file with root permissions, and leverage this new user account to login as root. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-10-11-powershell-script-with-webcam-video-capture-capabilities, PowerShell Script with Webcam Video Capture Capabilities>> | Detects PowerShell scripts that can be used to record webcam video. Attackers can capture this information to extort or spy on victims. | new | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-10-11-kirbi-file-creation, Kirbi File Creation>> | Identifies the creation of .kirbi files. The creation of this kind of file is an indicator of an attacker running Kerberos ticket dump utilities, such as Mimikatz, and precedes attacks such as Pass-The-Ticket (PTT), which allows the attacker to impersonate users using Kerberos tickets. | new | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-10-11-potential-enumeration-via-active-directory-web-service, Potential Enumeration via Active Directory Web Service>> | Identifies processes loading Active Directory related modules followed by a network connection to the ADWS dedicated TCP port. Adversaries may abuse the ADWS Windows service that allows Active Directory to be queried via this web service. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-10-11-suspicious-file-downloaded-from-google-drive, Suspicious File Downloaded from Google Drive>> | Identifies suspicious file download activity from a Google Drive URL. This could indicate an attempt to deliver phishing payloads via a trusted webservice. | update | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-10-11-firsttime-seen-account-performing-dcsync, FirstTime Seen Account Performing DCSync>> | This rule identifies when a User Account starts the Active Directory Replication Process for the first time. Attackers can use the DCSync technique to get credential information of individual accounts or the entire domain, thus compromising the entire domain. | update | 9 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-10-11-potential-credential-access-via-dcsync, Potential Credential Access via DCSync>> | This rule identifies when a User Account starts the Active Directory Replication Process. Attackers can use the DCSync technique to get credential information of individual accounts or the entire domain, thus compromising the entire domain. | update | 112 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-10-11-remote-scheduled-task-creation-via-rpc, Remote Scheduled Task Creation via RPC>> | Identifies scheduled task creation from a remote source. This could be indicative of adversary lateral movement. | update | 8 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-10-11-potential-modification-of-accessibility-binaries, Potential Modification of Accessibility Binaries>> | Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in. An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system. | update | 109 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-10-11-startup-or-run-key-registry-modification, Startup or Run Key Registry Modification>> | Identifies run key or startup key registry modifications. In order to survive reboots and other system interrupts, attackers will modify run keys within the registry or leverage startup folder items as a form of persistence. | update | 110
