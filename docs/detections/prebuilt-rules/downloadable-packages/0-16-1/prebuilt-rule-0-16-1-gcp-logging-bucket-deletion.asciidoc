=== GCP Logging Bucket Deletion

Identifies a Logging bucket deletion in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Log buckets are containers that store and organize log data. A deleted bucket stays in a pending state for 7 days, and Logging continues to route logs to the bucket during that time. To stop routing logs to a deleted bucket, the log sinks can be deleted that have the bucket as a destination, or the filter for the sinks can be modified to stop routing logs to the deleted bucket. An adversary may delete a log bucket to evade detection.
