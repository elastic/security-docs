=== Suspicious /proc/maps Discovery

Monitors for /proc/*/maps file reads. The /proc/*/maps file in Linux provides a memory map for a specific process, detailing the memory segments, permissions, and what files are mapped to these segments. Attackers may read a process's memory map to identify memory addresses for code injection or process hijacking.
