|<<prebuilt-rule-0-13-2-aws-rds-security-group-creation, AWS RDS Security Group Creation>> | Identifies the creation of an Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) Security Group. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-0-13-2-aws-rds-instance-creation, AWS RDS Instance Creation>> | Identifies the creation of an Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) Aurora database instance. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-0-13-2-aws-route-53-domain-transfer-lock-disabled, AWS Route 53 Domain Transfer Lock Disabled>> | Identifies when a transfer lock was removed from a Route 53 domain.

|<<prebuilt-rule-0-13-2-azure-service-principal-credentials-added, Azure Service Principal Credentials Added>> | Identifies when new Service Principal credentials have been added in Azure. In most organizations, credentials will be added to service principals infrequently. Hijacking an application (by adding a rogue secret or certificate) with granted permissions will allow the attacker to access data that is normally protected by MFA requirements. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-0-13-2-disabling-windows-defender-security-settings-via-powershell, Disabling Windows Defender Security Settings via PowerShell>> | Identifies use of the Set-MpPreference PowerShell command to disable or weaken certain Windows Defender settings. | new | 1

This is uncommon behavior and may indicate an attempt to evade defenses via side-loading a malicious DLL within the memory space of one of those processes. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-0-13-2-potential-printnightmare-file-modification, Potential PrintNightmare File Modification>> | Detects the creation or modification of a print driver with an unusual file name. This may indicate attempts to exploit privilege escalation vulnerabilities related to the Print Spooler service.

|<<prebuilt-rule-0-13-2-persistence-via-folder-action-script, Persistence via Folder Action Script>> | A Folder Action script is executed when the folder to which it is attached has items added or removed, or when its window is opened, closed, moved, or resized. Adversaries may abuse this feature to establish persistence by utilizing a malicious script. | update | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-0-13-2-attempts-to-brute-force-a-microsoft-365-user-account, Attempts to Brute Force a Microsoft 365 User Account>> | Identifies attempts to brute force a Microsoft 365 user account. An adversary may attempt a brute force attack to obtain unauthorized access to user accounts. | update | 5
