[[prebuilt-rule-8-11-6-potential-reverse-shell-via-child]]
=== Potential Reverse Shell via Child

This detection rule identifies suspicious network traffic patterns associated with TCP reverse shell activity. This activity consists of a network event that is followed by the creation of a shell process with suspicious command line arguments. An attacker may establish a Linux TCP reverse shell to gain remote access to a target system.
