|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-6-unusual-remote-file-size, Unusual Remote File Size>> | A machine learning job has detected an unusually high file size shared by a remote host indicating potential lateral movement activity. One of the primary goals of attackers after gaining access to a network is to locate and exfiltrate valuable information. Instead of multiple small transfers that can raise alarms, attackers might choose to bundle data into a single large file transfer. | update | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-6-high-variance-in-rdp-session-duration, High Variance in RDP Session Duration>> | A machine learning job has detected unusually high variance of RDP session duration.

This process has been classified as malicious in two ways. It was predicted to be malicious by the ProblemChild supervised ML model, and it was found to be suspicious given that its user context is unusual and does not commonly manifest malicious activity,by an unsupervised ML model. Such a process may be an instance of suspicious or malicious activity, possibly involving LOLbins, that may be resistant to detection using conventional search rules. | update | 2
