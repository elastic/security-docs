|==============================================
|Rule |Description |Status |Version

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-stolen-credentials-used-to-login-to-okta-account-after-mfa-reset, Stolen Credentials Used to Login to Okta Account After MFA Reset>> | Detects a sequence of suspicious activities on Windows hosts indicative of credential compromise, followed by efforts to undermine multi-factor authentication (MFA) and single sign-on (SSO) mechanisms for an Okta user account. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-suspicious-file-creation-via-kworker, Suspicious File Creation via Kworker>> | This rule monitors for a file creation event originating from a kworker parent process. kworker, or kernel worker, processes are part of the kernel's workqueue mechanism. They are responsible for executing work that has been scheduled to be done in kernel space, which might include tasks like handling interrupts, background activities, and other kernel-related tasks. Attackers may attempt to evade detection by masquerading as a kernel worker process. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-suspicious-kworker-uid-elevation, Suspicious Kworker UID Elevation>> | Monitors for the elevation of regular user permissions to root permissions through the kworker process. kworker, or kernel worker, processes are part of the kernel's workqueue mechanism. They are responsible for executing work that has been scheduled to be done in kernel space, which might include tasks like handling interrupts, background activities, and other kernel-related tasks. Attackers may attempt to evade detection by masquerading as a kernel worker process, and hijack the execution flow by hooking certain functions/syscalls through a rootkit in order to provide easy access to root via a special modified command. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-uid-elevation-from-previously-unknown-executable, UID Elevation from Previously Unknown Executable>> | Monitors for the elevation of regular user permissions to root permissions through a previously unknown executable. Attackers may attempt to evade detection by hijacking the execution flow and hooking certain functions/syscalls through a rootkit in order to provide easy access to root via a special modified command. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-rare-smb-connection-to-the-internet, Rare SMB Connection to the Internet>> | This rule detects rare internet network connections via the SMB protocol. SMB is commonly used to leak NTLM credentials via rogue UNC path injection. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-process-created-with-a-duplicated-token, Process Created with a Duplicated Token>> | Identifies the creation of a process impersonating the token of another user logon session. Adversaries may create a new process with a different token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-interactive-logon-by-an-unusual-process, Interactive Logon by an Unusual Process>> | Identifies interactive logon attempt with alternate credentials and by an unusual process. Adversaries may create a new token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-multiple-okta-user-auth-events-with-same-device-token-hash-behind-a-proxy, Multiple Okta User Auth Events with Same Device Token Hash Behind a Proxy>> | Detects when Okta user authentication events are reported for multiple users with the same device token hash behind a proxy. | update | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-okta-fastpass-phishing-detection, Okta FastPass Phishing Detection>> | Detects when Okta FastPass prevents a user from authenticating to a phishing website. | update | 103 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-system-binary-copied-and-or-moved-to-suspicious-directory, System Binary Copied and/or Moved to Suspicious Directory>> | This rule monitors for the copying or moving of a system binary to a suspicious directory. Adversaries may copy/move and rename system binaries to evade detection. Copying a system binary to a different location should not occur often, so if it does, the activity should be investigated. | update | 4 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-chkconfig-service-add, Chkconfig Service Add>> | Detects the use of the chkconfig binary to manually add a service for management by chkconfig. Threat actors may utilize this technique to maintain persistence on a system. When a new service is added, chkconfig ensures that the service has either a start or a kill entry in every runlevel and when the system is rebooted the service file added will run providing long-term persistence. | update | 109 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-cron-job-created-or-changed-by-previously-unknown-process, Cron Job Created or Changed by Previously Unknown Process>> | Linux cron jobs are scheduled tasks that can be leveraged by malicious actors for persistence, privilege escalation and command execution. By creating or modifying cron job configurations, attackers can execute malicious commands or scripts at predefined intervals, ensuring their continued presence and enabling unauthorized activities. | update | 7 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-suspicious-file-creation-in-etc-for-persistence, Suspicious File Creation in /etc for Persistence>> | Detects the manual creation of files in specific etc directories, via user root, used by Linux malware to persist and elevate privileges on compromised systems. File creation in these directories should not be entirely common and could indicate a malicious binary or script installing persistence mechanisms for long term access. | update | 111 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-setcap-setuid-setgid-capability-set, Setcap setuid/setgid Capability Set>> | This rule monitors for the addition of the cap_setuid+ep or cap_setgid+ep capabilities via setcap. Setuid (Set User ID) and setgid (Set Group ID) are Unix-like OS features that enable processes to run with elevated privileges, based on the file owner or group. Threat actors can exploit these attributes to achieve persistence by creating malicious binaries, allowing them to maintain control over a compromised system with elevated permissions. | update | 3 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-new-systemd-service-created-by-previously-unknown-process, New Systemd Service Created by Previously Unknown Process>> | Systemd service files are configuration files in Linux systems used to define and manage system services. Malicious actors can leverage systemd service files to achieve persistence by creating or modifying service files to execute malicious commands or payloads during system startup. This allows them to maintain unauthorized access, execute additional malicious activities, or evade detection. | update | 7 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-possible-fin7-dga-command-and-control-behavior, Possible FIN7 DGA Command and Control Behavior>> | This rule detects a known command and control pattern in network events. The FIN7 threat group is known to use this command and control technique, while maintaining persistence in their target's network. | update | 105 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-connection-to-commonly-abused-web-services, Connection to Commonly Abused Web Services>> | Adversaries may implement command and control (C2) communications that use common web services to hide their activity. This attack technique is typically targeted at an organization and uses web services common to the victim network, which allows the adversary to blend into legitimate traffic activity. These popular services are typically targeted since they have most likely been used before compromise, which helps malicious traffic blend in. | update | 110 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-remote-file-download-via-desktopimgdownldr-utility, Remote File Download via Desktopimgdownldr Utility>> | Identifies the desktopimgdownldr utility being used to download a remote file. An adversary may use desktopimgdownldr to download arbitrary files as an alternative to certutil. | update | 109 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-remote-file-download-via-mpcmdrun, Remote File Download via MpCmdRun>> | Identifies the Windows Defender configuration utility (MpCmdRun.exe) being used to download a remote file. | update | 109 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-remote-file-download-via-powershell, Remote File Download via PowerShell>> | Identifies powershell.exe being used to download an executable file from an untrusted remote destination. | update | 109 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-symbolic-link-to-shadow-copy-created, Symbolic Link to Shadow Copy Created>> | Identifies the creation of symbolic links to a shadow copy. Symbolic links can be used to access files in the shadow copy, including sensitive files such as ntds.dit, System Boot Key and browser offline credentials. | update | 109 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-potential-antimalware-scan-interface-bypass-via-powershell, Potential Antimalware Scan Interface Bypass via PowerShell>> | Identifies the execution of PowerShell script with keywords related to different Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) bypasses. An adversary may attempt first to disable AMSI before executing further malicious powershell scripts to evade detection. | update | 7 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-code-signing-policy-modification-through-registry, Code Signing Policy Modification Through Registry>> | Identifies attempts to disable the code signing policy through the registry. Code signing provides authenticity on a program, and grants the user with the ability to check whether the program has been tampered with. By allowing the execution of unsigned or self-signed code, threat actors can craft and execute malicious code. | update | 7 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-creation-or-modification-of-root-certificate, Creation or Modification of Root Certificate>> | Identifies the creation or modification of a local trusted root certificate in Windows. The install of a malicious root certificate would allow an attacker the ability to masquerade malicious files as valid signed components from any entity (for example, Microsoft). It could also allow an attacker to decrypt SSL traffic. | update | 108 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-windows-defender-disabled-via-registry-modification, Windows Defender Disabled via Registry Modification>> | Identifies modifications to the Windows Defender registry settings to disable the service or set the service to be started manually. | update | 109

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-process-execution-from-an-unusual-directory, Process Execution from an Unusual Directory>> | Identifies process execution from suspicious default Windows directories. This is sometimes done by adversaries to hide malware in trusted paths. | update | 108 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-suspicious-endpoint-security-parent-process, Suspicious Endpoint Security Parent Process>> | A suspicious Endpoint Security parent process was detected. This may indicate a process hollowing or other form of code injection. | update | 109 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-program-files-directory-masquerading, Program Files Directory Masquerading>> | Identifies execution from a directory masquerading as the Windows Program Files directories. These paths are trusted and usually host trusted third party programs. An adversary may leverage masquerading, along with low privileges to bypass detections allowlisting those folders. | update | 107 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-msbuild-making-network-connections, MsBuild Making Network Connections>> | Identifies MsBuild.exe making outbound network connections. This may indicate adversarial activity as MsBuild is often leveraged by adversaries to execute code and evade detection. | update | 106 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-unusual-network-activity-from-a-windows-system-binary, Unusual Network Activity from a Windows System Binary>> | Identifies network activity from unexpected system applications. This may indicate adversarial activity as these applications are often leveraged by adversaries to execute code and evade detection. | update | 109 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-process-termination-followed-by-deletion, Process Termination followed by Deletion>> | Identifies a process termination event quickly followed by the deletion of its executable file. Malware tools and other non-native files dropped or created on a system by an adversary may leave traces to indicate to what occurred. Removal of these files can occur during an intrusion, or as part of a post-intrusion process to minimize the adversary's footprint. | update | 108 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-unusual-child-processes-of-rundll32, Unusual Child Processes of RunDLL32>> | Identifies child processes of unusual instances of RunDLL32 where the command line parameters were suspicious. Misuse of RunDLL32 could indicate malicious activity. | update | 106 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-windows-subsystem-for-linux-enabled-via-dism-utility, Windows Subsystem for Linux Enabled via Dism Utility>> | Detects attempts to enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux using Microsoft Dism utility. Adversaries may enable and use WSL for Linux to avoid detection. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-windows-subsystem-for-linux-distribution-installed, Windows Subsystem for Linux Distribution Installed>> | Detects changes to the registry that indicates the install of a new Windows Subsystem for Linux distribution by name. Adversaries may enable and use WSL for Linux to avoid detection. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-group-policy-discovery-via-microsoft-gpresult-utility, Group Policy Discovery via Microsoft GPResult Utility>> | Detects the usage of gpresult.exe to query group policy objects. Attackers may query group policy objects during the reconnaissance phase after compromising a system to gain a better understanding of the active directory environment and possible methods to escalate privileges or move laterally. | update | 5 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-unusual-discovery-signal-alert-with-unusual-process-executable, Unusual Discovery Signal Alert with Unusual Process Executable>> | This rule leverages Discovery building block rule alert data to alert on signals with unusual unique host.id, user.id and process.executable entries. | update | 2 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-execution-of-file-written-or-modified-by-microsoft-office, Execution of File Written or Modified by Microsoft Office>> | Identifies an executable created by a Microsoft Office application and subsequently executed. These processes are often launched via scripts inside documents or during exploitation of Microsoft Office applications. | update | 108 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-suspicious-image-load-taskschd-dll-from-ms-office, Suspicious Image Load (taskschd.dll) from MS Office>> | Identifies a suspicious image load (taskschd.dll) from Microsoft Office processes. This behavior may indicate adversarial activity where a scheduled task is configured via Windows Component Object Model (COM). This technique can be used to configure persistence and evade monitoring by avoiding the usage of the traditional Windows binary (schtasks.exe) used to manage scheduled tasks. | update | 107 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-potential-persistence-via-time-provider-modification, Potential Persistence via Time Provider Modification>> | Identifies modification of the Time Provider. Adversaries may establish persistence by registering and enabling a malicious DLL as a time provider. Windows uses the time provider architecture to obtain accurate time stamps from other network devices or clients in the network. Time providers are implemented in the form of a DLL file which resides in the System32 folder. The service W32Time initiates during the startup of Windows and loads w32time.dll. | update | 106 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-persistence-via-wmi-standard-registry-provider, Persistence via WMI Standard Registry Provider>> | Identifies use of the Windows Management Instrumentation StdRegProv (registry provider) to modify commonly abused registry locations for persistence. | update | 106 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-11-5-powershell-script-with-token-impersonation-capabilities, PowerShell Script with Token Impersonation Capabilities>> | Detects scripts that contain PowerShell functions, structures, or Windows API functions related to token impersonation/theft.
