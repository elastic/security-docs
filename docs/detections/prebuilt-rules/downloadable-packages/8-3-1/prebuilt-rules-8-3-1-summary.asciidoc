This section lists all updates associated with version 8.3.1 of the Fleet integration *Prebuilt Security Detection Rules*.


[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
|Rule |Description |Status |Version

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-elastic-agent-service-terminated, Elastic Agent Service Terminated>> | Identifies the Elastic endpoint agent has stopped and is no longer running on the host. Adversaries may attempt to disable security monitoring tools in an attempt to evade detection or prevention capabilities during an intrusion. This may also indicate an issue with the agent itself and should be addressed to ensure defensive measures are back in a stable state. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-modification-of-standard-authentication-module-or-configuration, Modification of Standard Authentication Module or Configuration>> | Adversaries may modify the standard authentication module for persistence via patching the normal authorization process or modifying the login configuration to allow unauthorized access or elevate privileges. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-ssh-authorized-keys-file-modification, SSH Authorized Keys File Modification>> | The Secure Shell (SSH) authorized_keys file specifies which users are allowed to log into a server using public key authentication. Adversaries may modify it to maintain persistence on a victim host by adding their own public key(s). | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-unusual-city-for-an-aws-command, Unusual City For an AWS Command>> | A machine learning job detected AWS command activity that, while not inherently suspicious or abnormal, is sourcing from a geolocation (city) that is unusual for the command. This can be the result of compromised credentials or keys being used by a threat actor in a different geography than the authorized user(s). | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-unusual-country-for-an-aws-command, Unusual Country For an AWS Command>> | A machine learning job detected AWS command activity that, while not inherently suspicious or abnormal, is sourcing from a geolocation (country) that is unusual for the command. This can be the result of compromised credentials or keys being used by a threat actor in a different geography than the authorized user(s). | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-unusual-aws-command-for-a-user, Unusual AWS Command for a User>> | A machine learning job detected an AWS API command that, while not inherently suspicious or abnormal, is being made by a user context that does not normally use the command. This can be the result of compromised credentials or keys as someone uses a valid account to persist, move laterally, or exfiltrate data. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-aws-root-login-without-mfa, AWS Root Login Without MFA>> | Identifies attempts to login to AWS as the root user without using multi-factor authentication (MFA). Amazon AWS best practices indicate that the root user should be protected by MFA. | update | 101 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-azure-automation-runbook-deleted, Azure Automation Runbook Deleted>> | Identifies when an Azure Automation runbook is deleted. An adversary may delete an Azure Automation runbook in order to disrupt their target's automated business operations or to remove a malicious runbook for defense evasion. | update | 101 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-azure-active-directory-high-risk-sign-in, Azure Active Directory High Risk Sign-in>> | Identifies high risk Azure Active Directory (AD) sign-ins by leveraging Microsoft's Identity Protection machine learning and heuristics. Identity Protection categorizes risk into three tiers: low, medium, and high. While Microsoft does not provide specific details about how risk is calculated, each level brings higher confidence that the user or sign-in is compromised. | update | 101 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-azure-active-directory-high-risk-user-sign-in-heuristic, Azure Active Directory High Risk User Sign-in Heuristic>> | Identifies high risk Azure Active Directory (AD) sign-ins by leveraging Microsoft Identity Protection machine learning and heuristics. | update | 101 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-possible-consent-grant-attack-via-azure-registered-application, Possible Consent Grant Attack via Azure-Registered Application>> | Detects when a user grants permissions to an Azure-registered application or when an administrator grants tenant-wide permissions to an application. An adversary may create an Azure-registered application that requests access to data such as contact information, email, or documents. | update | 101 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-azure-privilege-identity-management-role-modified, Azure Privilege Identity Management Role Modified>> | Azure Active Directory (AD) Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is a service that enables you to manage, control, and monitor access to important resources in an organization. PIM can be used to manage the built-in Azure resource roles such as Global Administrator and Application Administrator. An adversary may add a user to a PIM role in order to maintain persistence in their target's environment or modify a PIM role to weaken their target's security controls. | update | 101 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-kubernetes-suspicious-self-subject-review, Kubernetes Suspicious Self-Subject Review>> | This rule detects when a service account or node attempts to enumerate their own permissions via the selfsubjectaccessreview or selfsubjectrulesreview APIs. This is highly unusual behavior for non-human identities like service accounts and nodes. An adversary may have gained access to credentials/tokens and this could be an attempt to determine what privileges they have to facilitate further movement or execution within the cluster. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-kubernetes-user-exec-into-pod, Kubernetes User Exec into Pod>> | This rule detects a user attempt to establish a shell session into a pod using the 'exec' command. Using the 'exec' command in a pod allows a user to establish a temporary shell session and execute any process/commands in the pod. An adversary may call bash to gain a persistent interactive shell which will allow access to any data the pod has permissions to, including secrets. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-kubernetes-pod-created-with-a-sensitive-hostpath-volume, Kubernetes Pod created with a Sensitive hostPath Volume>> | This rule detects when a pod is created with a sensitive volume of type hostPath. A hostPath volume type mounts a sensitive file or folder from the node to the container. If the container gets compromised, the attacker can use this mount for gaining access to the node. There are many ways a container with unrestricted access to the host filesystem can escalate privileges, including reading data from other containers, and accessing tokens of more privileged pods. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-microsoft-365-inbox-forwarding-rule-created, Microsoft 365 Inbox Forwarding Rule Created>> | Identifies when a new Inbox forwarding rule is created in Microsoft 365. Inbox rules process messages in the Inbox based on conditions and take actions. In this case, the rules will forward the emails to a defined address. Attackers can abuse Inbox Rules to intercept and exfiltrate email data without making organization-wide configuration changes or having the corresponding privileges. | update | 101 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-suspicious-network-connection-attempt-by-root, Suspicious Network Connection Attempt by Root>> | Identifies an outbound network connection attempt followed by a session id change as the root user by the same process entity. This particular instantiation of a network connection is abnormal and should be investigated as it may indicate a potential reverse shell activity via a privileged process. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-creation-of-hidden-shared-object-file, Creation of Hidden Shared Object File>> | Identifies the creation of a hidden shared object (.so) file. Users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a "." as the first character in the file or folder name. Adversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders on the system for persistence and defense evasion. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-abnormal-process-id-or-lock-file-created, Abnormal Process ID or Lock File Created>> | Identifies the creation of a Process ID (PID), lock or reboot file created in temporary file storage paradigm (tmpfs) directory /var/run. On Linux, the PID files typically hold the process ID to track previous copies running and manage other tasks. Certain Linux malware use the /var/run directory for holding data, executables and other tasks, disguising itself or these files as legitimate PID files. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-binary-executed-from-shared-memory-directory, Binary Executed from Shared Memory Directory>> | Identifies the execution of a binary by root in Linux shared memory directories: (/dev/shm/, /run/shm/, /var/run/, /var/lock/). This activity is to be considered highly abnormal and should be investigated. Threat actors have placed executables used for persistence on high-uptime servers in these directories as system backdoors. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-interactive-terminal-spawned-via-python, Interactive Terminal Spawned via Python>> | Identifies when a terminal (tty) is spawned via Python. Attackers may upgrade a simple reverse shell to a fully interactive tty after obtaining initial access to a host. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-chkconfig-service-add, Chkconfig Service Add>> | Detects the use of the chkconfig binary to manually add a service for management by chkconfig. Threat actors may utilize this technique to maintain persistence on a system. When a new service is added, chkconfig ensures that the service has either a start or a kill entry in every runlevel and when the system is rebooted the service file added will run providing long-term persistence. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-dynamic-linker-copy, Dynamic Linker Copy>> | Detects the copying of the Linux dynamic loader binary and subsequent file creation for the purpose of creating a backup copy. This technique was seen recently being utilized by Linux malware prior to patching the dynamic loader in order to inject and preload a malicious shared object file. This activity should never occur and if it does then it should be considered highly suspicious or malicious. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-suspicious-file-creation-in-etc-for-persistence, Suspicious File Creation in /etc for Persistence>> | Detects the manual creation of files in specific etc directories, via user root, used by Linux malware to persist and elevate privileges on compromised systems. File creation in these directories should not be entirely common and could indicate a malicious binary or script installing persistence for long term access. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-kernel-module-load-via-insmod, Kernel module load via insmod>> | Detects the use of the insmod binary to load a Linux kernel object file. Threat actors can use this binary, given they have root privileges, to load a rootkit on a system providing them with complete control and the ability to hide from security products. Manually loading a kernel module in this manner should not be at all common and can indicate suspcious or malicious behavior. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-softwareupdate-preferences-modification, SoftwareUpdate Preferences Modification>> | Identifies changes to the SoftwareUpdate preferences using the built-in defaults command. Adversaries may abuse this in an attempt to disable security updates. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-attempt-to-disable-gatekeeper, Attempt to Disable Gatekeeper>> | Detects attempts to disable Gatekeeper on macOS. Gatekeeper is a security feature that's designed to ensure that only trusted software is run. Adversaries may attempt to disable Gatekeeper before executing malicious code. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-suspicious-browser-child-process, Suspicious Browser Child Process>> | Identifies the execution of a suspicious browser child process. Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing. With this technique, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-macos-installer-package-spawns-network-event, MacOS Installer Package Spawns Network Event>> | Detects the execution of a MacOS installer package with an abnormal child process (e.g bash) followed immediately by a network connection via a suspicious process (e.g curl). Threat actors will build and distribute malicious MacOS installer packages, which have a .pkg extension, many times imitating valid software in order to persuade and infect their victims often using the package files (e.g pre/post install scripts etc.) to download additional tools or malicious software. If this rule fires it should indicate the installation of a malicious or suspicious package. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-suspicious-macos-ms-office-child-process, Suspicious macOS MS Office Child Process>> | Identifies suspicious child processes of frequently targeted Microsoft Office applications (Word, PowerPoint, and Excel).

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-potential-kerberos-attack-via-bifrost, Potential Kerberos Attack via Bifrost>> | Identifies use of Bifrost, a known macOS Kerberos pentesting tool, which can be used to dump cached Kerberos tickets or attempt unauthorized authentication techniques such as pass-the-ticket/hash and kerberoasting. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-launch-agent-creation-or-modification-and-immediate-loading, Launch Agent Creation or Modification and Immediate Loading>> | An adversary can establish persistence by installing a new launch agent that executes at login by using launchd or launchctl to load a plist into the appropriate directories. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-suspicious-crontab-creation-or-modification, Suspicious CronTab Creation or Modification>> | Identifies attempts to create or modify a crontab via a process that is not crontab (i.e python, osascript, etc.). This activity should not be highly prevalent and could indicate the use of cron as a persistence mechanism by a threat actor. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-persistence-via-docker-shortcut-modification, Persistence via Docker Shortcut Modification>> | An adversary can establish persistence by modifying an existing macOS dock property list in order to execute a malicious application instead of the intended one when invoked. | update | 100 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-3-1-finder-sync-plugin-registered-and-enabled, Finder Sync Plugin Registered and Enabled>> | Finder Sync plugins enable users to extend Finder’s functionality by modifying the user interface.
