|==============================================
|Rule |Description |Status |Version

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-14-11-aws-ssm-sendcommand-with-run-shell-command-parameters, AWS SSM `SendCommand` with Run Shell Command Parameters>> | Identifies the use of the AWS Systems Manager (SSM) `SendCommand` API with the either `AWS-RunShellScript` or `AWS-RunPowerShellScript` parameters. The `SendCommand` API call allows users to execute commands on EC2 instances using the SSM service. Adversaries may use this technique to execute commands on EC2 instances without the need for SSH or RDP access. This behavior may indicate an adversary attempting to execute commands on an EC2 instance for malicious purposes. This is a [New Terms](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/rules-ui-create.html#create-new-terms-rule) rule that only flags when this behavior is observed for the first time on a host in the last 7 days. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-14-11-aws-bedrock-detected-multiple-validation-exception-errors-by-a-single-user, AWS Bedrock Detected Multiple Validation Exception Errors by a Single User>> | Identifies multiple validation exeception errors within AWS Bedrock. Validation errors occur when you run the InvokeModel or InvokeModelWithResponseStream APIs on a foundation model that uses an incorrect inference parameter or corresponding value. These errors also occur when you use an inference parameter for one model with a model that doesn't have the same API parameter. This could indicate attempts to bypass limitations of other approved models, or to force an impact on the environment by incurring exhorbitant costs. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-14-11-azure-entra-sign-in-brute-force-against-microsoft-365-accounts, Azure Entra Sign-in Brute Force against Microsoft 365 Accounts>> | Identifies potential brute-force attempts against Microsoft 365 user accounts by detecting a high number of failed interactive or non-interactive login attempts within a 30-minute window. Attackers may attempt to brute force user accounts to gain unauthorized access to Microsoft 365 services via different services such as Exchange, SharePoint, or Teams. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-14-11-azure-entra-sign-in-brute-force-microsoft-365-accounts-by-repeat-source, Azure Entra Sign-in Brute Force Microsoft 365 Accounts by Repeat Source>> | Identifies potential brute-force attempts against Microsoft 365 user accounts by detecting a high number of failed interactive or non-interactive login attempts within a 30-minute window from a single source. Attackers may attempt to brute force user accounts to gain unauthorized access to Microsoft 365 services via different services such as Exchange, SharePoint, or Teams. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-14-11-microsoft-365-portal-logins-from-impossible-travel-locations, Microsoft 365 Portal Logins from Impossible Travel Locations>> | Detects successful Microsoft 365 portal logins from impossible travel locations. Impossible travel locations are defined as two different countries within a short time frame. This behavior may indicate an adversary attempting to access a Microsoft 365 account from a compromised account or a malicious actor attempting to access a Microsoft 365 account from a different location. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-14-11-microsoft-365-portal-login-from-rare-location, Microsoft 365 Portal Login from Rare Location>> | Detects successful Microsoft 365 portal logins from rare locations. Rare locations are defined as locations that are not commonly associated with the user's account. This behavior may indicate an adversary attempting to access a Microsoft 365 account from an unusual location or behind a VPN. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-14-11-unauthorized-scope-for-public-app-oauth2-token-grant-with-client-credentials, Unauthorized Scope for Public App OAuth2 Token Grant with Client Credentials>> | Identifies a failed OAuth 2.0 token grant attempt for a public client app using client credentials. This event is generated when a public client app attempts to exchange a client credentials grant for an OAuth 2.0 access token, but the request is denied due to the lack of required scopes. This could indicate compromised client credentials in which an adversary is attempting to obtain an access token for unauthorized scopes. This is a [New Terms](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/rules-ui-create.html#create-new-terms-rule) rule where the `okta.actor.display_name` field value has not been seen in the last 14 days regarding this event. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-14-11-unusual-instance-metadata-service-imds-api-request, Unusual Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) API Request>> | This rule identifies potentially malicious processes attempting to access the cloud service provider's instance metadata service (IMDS) API endpoint, which can be used to retrieve sensitive instance-specific information such as instance ID, public IP address, and even temporary security credentials if role's are assumed by that instance. The rule monitors for various tools and scripts like curl, wget, python, and perl that might be used to interact with the metadata API. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-14-11-root-certificate-installation, Root Certificate Installation>> | This rule detects the installation of root certificates on a Linux system. Adversaries may install a root certificate on a compromised system to avoid warnings when connecting to their command and control servers. Root certificates are used in public key cryptography to identify a root certificate authority (CA). When a root certificate is installed, the system or application will trust certificates in the root's chain of trust that have been signed by the root certificate. | new | 1 

|<<prebuilt-rule-8-14-11-suspicious-pbpaste-high-volume-activity, Suspicious pbpaste High Volume Activity>> | Identifies a high volume of `pbpaste` executions, which may indicate a bash loop continuously collecting clipboard contents, potentially allowing an attacker to harvest user credentials or other sensitive information. | new | 1
