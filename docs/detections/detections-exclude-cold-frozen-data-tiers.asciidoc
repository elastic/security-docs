== Exclude cold and frozen data from individual rules

:frontmatter-description: Configure a rule to ignore cold and frozen data during execution.

Your rule might perform slower or fail if it queries data from cold and frozen {ref}/data-tiers.html[data tiers]. To help Elasticsearch efficiently exclude cold and frozen data, apply a Query DSL filter that ignores cold and frozen documents when your rule executes. You can add the filter when creating a new rule or updating an existing one.

TIP: To ensure that the rules in a {kib} space exclude cold and frozen documents when executing, configure the `excludedDataTiersForRuleExecution` <<exclude-cold-frozen-data-rule-executions,advanced setting>>.

[IMPORTANT]
====

* This method is not supported for {esql} and {ml} rules.
* Indicator match, event correlation, and {esql} rules might fail if a frozen or cold shard that matches the rule's specified index pattern is unavailable during rule executions. The best path forward continues to be modifying the index patterns to only use hot tier data.

Here is a sample Query DSL filter that excludes documents from a frozen tier during a rule's execution:

[source,console]
----
{
   "bool":{
      "must_not":{
         "terms":{
            "_tier":[
               "data_frozen"
            ]
         }
      }
   }
}

Here is another sample Query DSL filter that excludes documents from cold and frozen tiers during a ruleâ€™s execution:

[source,console]
----
{
   "bool":{
      "must_not":{
         "terms":{
            "_tier":[
               "data_frozen", "data_cold"
            ]
         }
      }
   }
}
