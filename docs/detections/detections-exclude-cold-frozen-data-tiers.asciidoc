Rules that query cold and frozen data might perform more slowly. To exclude cold and frozen data, add a Query DSL filter that ignores cold and frozen {ref}/data-tiers.html[data tiers] when executing. You can add the filter when creating a new rule or updating an existing one. 

NOTE: This method is not supported for {esql} and {ml} rules.

TIP: To ensure that _all_ rules in a {kib} space exclude cold and frozen data when executing, configure the `excludedDataTiersForRuleExecution` <<exclude-cold-frozen-data-rule-executions,advanced setting>>.

Here is a sample Query DSL filter that excludes frozen tier data from a rule's execution:

[source,console]
----
{
   "bool":{
      "must_not":{
         "terms":{
            "_tier":[
               "data_frozen"
            ]
         }
      }
   }
}

Here is another sample Query DSL filter that excludes cold and frozen tier data from a rule's execution:

[source,console]
----
{
   "bool":{
      "must_not":{
         "terms":{
            "_tier":[
               "data_frozen", "data_cold"
            ]
         }
      }
   }
}
