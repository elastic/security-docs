== Rule exceptions

Rule exceptions are associated with detection and endpoint rules, and are used to prevent a rule from generating an alert from incoming events even when the rule's other criteria are met. 

Exceptions are made up of three main components: exception items, default rule lists, and shared exception lists.

=== Exception items

Exception items, also referred to as _exceptions_, contain the source event conditions that determine when alerts are not generated. They can be used to reduce the number of false positives, and to prevent trusted processes and network activity from generating unnecessary alerts. 

A rule can have multiple exceptions and an exception can be used by multiple rules. Refer to <<add-exceptions>> to learn more about adding exceptions to rules. 

NOTE: You can also use <<value-lists-exceptions,value lists>> to define exceptions for detection rules.

=== Default rule lists

A default rule list is a group of exceptions that belong to a single rule. Exceptions within a rule's default rule list cannot be used by other rules. Refer to <<add-exceptions>> to learn more.

=== Shared exception lists
A shared exception list is a group of exception items that can be used by multiple rules. You can create, import, and manage shared exception lists from the Rule Exceptions page. Refer to <<shared-exception-lists>> to learn more.
