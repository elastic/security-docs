== Rule exceptions and value lists

To prevent the creation of unwanted alerts, you can add exceptions to any rule. Exceptions contain the source event conditions that determine when
alerts are not generated. They provide a convenient way of allowing trusted
processes and network activity to function without producing unnecessary noise.

You can add multiple exceptions to one rule.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
When you add an exception to the
<<endpoint-rule-exceptions, Elastic Endpoint Security>> rule, you can select to
add the exception to the Endpoint. When selected, the exception is added to
both the detection rule *and* the Elastic Endpoint agent on your hosts.

{ref}/binary.html[Binary fields] are not supported in detection rule exceptions.
=====

In addition to defining exception queries for source event values, you can use rule
exceptions with value lists. Value lists are lists of items with
the same {es} {ref}/mapping-types.html[data type]. You can create value lists
with these types:

* `Keywords` (many {ecs-ref}/ecs-field-reference.html[ECS fields] are keywords)
* `IP Addresses`
* `IP Ranges`
* `Text`

After creating value lists, you can use `is in list` and `is not in list`
operators to define exceptions.

IMPORTANT: Operators `is in list` and `is not in list` are not available for
threshold and event correlation rules.

== Create value lists

To create a value list:

. Prepare a `txt` or `csv` file with all the values you want to use for
determining exceptions from a single list. If you use a `txt` file, new lines
act as value delimiters.
+
[IMPORTANT]
=========================
* All values in the file must be of the same {es} type.

* Wildcards are not supported in rule exceptions or value lists. Values must be literal values.
=========================

. Go to *Detect* -> *Rules*.
. Click *Upload value lists*. The *Upload value lists* window opens.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/upload-lists-ui.png[]

. Select the list type (*Keywords*, *IP addresses*, *IP ranges*, or *Text*) from the *Type of value list* drop-down.
. Drag or select the `csv` or `txt` file that contains the values.
. Click *Upload list*.

NOTE: When the name of the file you are uploading already exists, the values in
the new file are appended to the previously uploaded values.

=== Manage value lists

To view, delete, or export existing value lists:

. Go to *Detect* -> *Rules*.
. Click *Upload value lists*. The *Upload value lists* window opens.
. In the *Value lists* table, click the required action button.

[[detection-rule-exceptions]]
=== Add exceptions to a rule

You can add exceptions to a rule from the rule details page or the Alerts table.
When you add an exception, you can also close all alerts that meet the
exception's criteria.

[IMPORTANT]
==============
Be careful when adding exceptions to event correlation rules. Exceptions are evaluated against every event in the sequence, and when the exception matches _all_ event(s) in the sequence, alerts _are not_ generated. If the exception only matches _some_ of the events in the sequence, alerts _are_ generated. 

To exclude values from a
specific event in the sequence, update the rule's EQL statement. For example:

[source,eql]
----
`sequence
  [file where file.extension == "exe"
  and file.name != "app-name.exe"]
  [process where true
  and process.name != "process-name.exe"]`
----
==============

. Do one of the following:
+
--
* To add an exception from the rule details page:
.. Go to the rule details page of the rule to which you want to add an
exception (*Detect* -> *Rules* -> *_<Rule name>_*).
.. Scroll down below the rule details and select the *Exceptions* tab.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/exception-histogram.png[Detail of Exceptions tab, 75%]
.. Click *Add new exception* -> *Add rule exception*.

* To add an exception from the Alerts table:
.. Go to *Detect* -> *Alerts*.
.. Scroll down to the Alerts table, go to the alert you want to create an exception for, click the *More Actions* menu (*...*), then select *Add rule exception*.

The *Add Rule Exception* flyout opens (the example below was opened from the Alerts table):
--
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/add-exception-ui.png[]
. Add conditions that define when the exception prevents alerts. You can define
multiple conditions with `OR` and `AND` relationships. In the example above,
the exception prevents the rule from generating alerts when the
`svchost.exe` process runs on agent hostname `siem-kibana`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
============
* You can use nested conditions. However, this is only required for
<<nested-field-list, these fields>>. For all other fields, nested conditions
should not be used.

* Wildcards are not supported in rule exceptions or value lists. Values must be literal values.
============
+
If you have created value lists, you can use them to exclude or include all
values in a list with `is in list` and `is not in list` operators:
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/exceptions-ui-list.png[]
NOTE: When using a list, all exception statements must use `is in list` and
`is not in list` operators.

. Select one of the following alert actions:

* *Close this alert*: Closes the alert when the exception is added. This option
is only available when adding exceptions from the Alerts table.
* *Close all alerts that match this exception and were generated by this rule*:
Closes all alerts that match the exception's conditions and were generated only by the current rule.
+
. Click *Add Rule Exception*.

[float]
[[endpoint-rule-exceptions]]
=== Add Elastic {endpoint-sec} exceptions

Like detection rule exceptions, you can add Endpoint agent exceptions either by editing the Elastic {endpoint-sec} rule or by adding them as an action on alerts generated by the {endpoint-sec} rule. Elastic {endpoint-sec} alerts have the following fields:

* `kibana.alert.original_event.module determined:endpoint`
* `kibana.alert.original_event.kind:alert`

You can also add Endpoint exceptions to rules that are associated with {elastic-endpoint} rule exceptions. To associate rules, when creating or editing a rule, select the <<rule-ui-advanced-params, *{elastic-endpoint} exceptions*>> option.

[IMPORTANT]
=============
Exceptions added to the Elastic {endpoint-sec} rule affect all alerts sent
from the Endpoint agent. Be careful not to unintentionally prevent some Endpoint
alerts.

Additionally, to add an Endpoint exception to the Elastic {endpoint-sec} rule, there must be at least one {endpoint-sec} alert generated in the system. For non-production use, if no alerts exist, you can trigger a test alert using malware emulation techniques or tools such as the Anti Malware Testfile from the https://www.eicar.org/[European Institute for Computer Anti-Virus Research (EICAR)].
=============

. Do one of the following:
+
--
* To add an Endpoint exception from the rule details page:
.. Go to the rule details page (*Detect* -> *Rules*), and then search for and  select the Elastic *Security Endpoint* rule.
.. Scroll down to the *Trend* histogram and select the *Exceptions* tab.
.. Click *Add new exception* -> *Add Endpoint exception*.
* To add an Endpoint exception from the Alerts table:
.. Go to *Detect* -> *Alerts*.
.. Scroll down to the Alerts table, and from an Elastic Security Endpoint
alert, click the *More actions* menu (*...*), then select *Add Endpoint exception*.
--
+
The *Add Endpoint Exception* flyout opens, from either the rule details page or the Alerts table.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/endpoint-add-exp.png[]
. If required, modify the conditions.
+
NOTE: See <<ex-nested-conditions>> for more information on when nested conditions are required.

. You can select any of the following:

* *Close this alert*: Closes the alert when the exception is added. This option
is only available when adding exceptions from the Alerts table.
* *Close all alerts that match this exception and were generated by this rule*:
Closes all alerts that match the exception's conditions.

. Click *Add Endpoint Exception*. An exception is created for both the detection rule and the {elastic-endpoint}.

[[ex-nested-conditions]]
=== Exceptions with nested conditions

Some Endpoint objects contain nested fields, and the only way to ensure you are
excluding the correct fields is with nested conditions. One example is the
`process.Ext` object:

[source, json]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "ancestry": [],
  "code_signature": {
    "trusted": true,
    "subject_name": "LFC",
    "exists": true,
    "status": "trusted"
  },
  "user": "WDAGUtilityAccount",
  "token": {
    "elevation": true,
    "integrity_level_name": "high",
    "domain": "27FB305D-3838-4",
    "user": "WDAGUtilityAccount",
    "elevation_type": "default",
    "sid": "S-1-5-21-2047949552-857980807-821054962-504"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------


TIP: `code_signature.subject_name` refers to the process signature not the
process name.

[[nested-field-list]]
Only these objects require nested conditions to ensure the exception functions
correctly:

* `Endpoint.policy.applied.artifacts.global.identifiers`
* `Endpoint.policy.applied.artifacts.user.identifiers`
* `Target.dll.Ext.code_signature`
* `Target.process.Ext.code_signature`
* `Target.process.Ext.token.privileges`
* `Target.process.parent.Ext.code_signature`
* `Target.process.thread.Ext.token.privileges`
* `dll.Ext.code_signature`
* `file.Ext.code_signature`
* `file.Ext.macro.errors`
* `file.Ext.macro.stream`
* `process.Ext.code_signature`
* `process.Ext.token.privileges`
* `process.parent.Ext.code_signature`
* `process.thread.Ext.token.privileges`

=== View and manage exception lists

The Exception lists table enables you to view and manage all exceptions that have been assigned to rules. To view the Exception lists table, go to *Detect* -> *Exception lists*.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/exceptions-page.png[]

Exceptions are automatically grouped into exception lists. The table displays each exception list on an individual row, with the most recently created list at the top. Each row contains information such as the name of the rule to which the exception list is assigned, the dates when the list was created and last edited, and options to export or delete it.

TIP: To view details of the rule the exception list is assigned to, click the link in the `Rules assigned to` column.

To filter exception lists by a specific value, enter a query in the https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/forms/search-bar[Search bar]. You can search the following attributes:

* `name`
* `list_id`
* `created_by`
* `type`
* `tags`

If no attribute is selected, the app searches the list name by default.

To export or delete an exception list, select the required action button on the appropriate list. Note that:

* Exception lists are exported to `.ndjson` files.
* Exception lists are also exported as part of any exported detection rules configured with exceptions. See <<import-export-rules-ui>>.
* If a list is linked to any rules, you'll see a warning appear that asks you to confirm the deletion. If no rules are linked to a list, it is deleted without confirmation.
