== Rule exceptions

To prevent the creation of unwanted alerts, you can add exceptions to any rule. Exceptions contain the source event conditions that determine when alerts are not generated. They provide a convenient way of allowing trusted
processes and network activity to function without producing unnecessary noise.

You can add multiple exceptions to a single rule. An exception can also apply to multiple rules.

TIP: To find out if an exception is used by other rules, select the *Rule exceptions* or *Endpoint exceptions* tab, navigate to an exception list item, then click *Affects _X_ rules*.
