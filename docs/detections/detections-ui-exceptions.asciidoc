== Rule exceptions

Rule exceptions can be associated with detection and endpoint rules to prevent those rules from generating alerts under specific circumstances. Exceptions are made up of three main components: exception items, default rule lists, and shared exception lists.

=== Exception items

Exception items, also referred to as _exceptions_, contain the source event conditions that determine when alerts are not generated. You can use exceptions to reduce the number of false positives, and to prevent trusted processes and network activity from generating unnecessary alerts. 

Rules can have multiple exceptions and exceptions can apply to multiple rules. Refer to <<add-exceptions>> to learn more about adding exceptions to rules.

NOTE: You can also use <<value-lists-exceptions,value lists>> to define exceptions for detection rules. Value lists allow you to match an exception against a list of possible values.

[[default-rule-list-intro]]
=== Default rule lists

A default rule list is a group of exceptions that belong to a single rule. Exceptions within a rule's default rule list cannot be used by other rules. Refer to <<add-exceptions>> to learn more.

[[shared-exception-list-intro]]
=== Shared exception lists

Shared exception lists allow you to group exceptions together and then apply them to multiple rules. Use the Shared Exception Lists page to set up a shared exception list with exception items, and then associate the list with multiple detection rules. Refer to <<shared-exception-lists>> to learn more.
