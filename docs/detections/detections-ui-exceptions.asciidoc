== Rule exceptions

Rule exceptions are associated with detection and endpoint rules, and are used to prevent a rule from generating an alert from incoming events even when the rule's other criteria are met. 

Exceptions contain the source event conditions that determine when alerts are _not_ generated. They can be used to reduce the number of false positives, and to prevent trusted processes and network activity from generating unnecessary alerts. You can also use value lists to define exceptions for detection rules. Refer to <<value-lists-exceptions>> to learn more.

The exceptions feature is made up of several components:

* *Exception item*: An individual exception. 
* *Default rule list*: A list of exceptions for an individual rule.
* *Shared exception list*: A logical group of exceptions that can be shared by multiple rules.
