== Rule exceptions

Rule exceptions are associated with detection and endpoint rules, and are used to prevent a rule from generating an alert from incoming events even when the rule's other criteria are met. 

Exceptions contain the source event conditions that determine when alerts are _not_ generated. They can be used to reduce the number of false positives, and to prevent trusted processes and network activity from generating unnecessary alerts. You can also use <<value-lists-exceptions,value lists>> to define exceptions for detection rules. 

You can add multiple exceptions to a single rule. An exception can also apply to multiple rules.

The exceptions feature has three main components:

* *Exception item*: A single exception. You can add an exception item to a default rule list or a shared exception list.
* *Default rule list*: A group of exception items that belong to a single detection rule. Exception items within a rule's default rule list _cannot_ be used by any other rules.
* *Shared exception list*: A group of exception items that _can_ be used by multiple detection rules.

The following sections provide more information about <<add-exceptions,adding>>, <<manage-exception,managing,>> and <<shared-exception-lists,sharing>> exceptions.
