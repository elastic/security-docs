Osquery is an open source tool that lets you use SQL to query operating systems like a database. When you add the {kibana-ref}/manage-osquery-integration.html[Osquery manager integration] to an {agent} policy, Osquery is deployed to all agents assigned to that policy. After completing this setup, you can {kibana-ref}/osquery.html[run live queries and schedule recurring queries] for agents and begin gathering data from your entire environment.

Osquery is supported for Linux, macOS, and Windows. You can use it with {elastic-sec} to perform real-time incident response, threat hunting, and monitoring to detect vulnerability or compliance issues. The following Osquery features are available from {elastic-sec}:

* *<<osquery-response-action,Osquery Response Actions>>* - Use Osquery Response Actions to add live queries to custom query rules.
* *<<invest-guide-run-osquery,Live queries from investigation guides>>* - Incorporate live queries into investigation guides to enhance your research capabilities while investigating possible security issues.
* *<<alerts-run-osquery,Live queries from alerts>>* - Run live queries against an alert's host to learn more about your infrastructure and operating systems.
