=== View and manage exception lists

The Exception lists table enables you to view and manage all exceptions that have been assigned to rules. To view the Exception lists table, go to *Manage* -> *Exception lists*.

Exceptions are automatically grouped into exception lists. The table displays each exception list on an individual row, with the most recently created list at the top. Each row contains information such as the name of the rule to which the exception list is assigned, the dates when the list was created and last edited, and options to export or delete it.

TIP: To view details of the rule the exception list is assigned to, click the link in the `Rules assigned to` column.

To filter exception lists by a specific value, enter a query in the https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/forms/search-bar[Search bar]. You can search the following attributes:

* `name`
* `list_id`
* `created_by`
* `type`
* `tags`

If no attribute is selected, the app searches the list name by default.

To export or delete an exception list, select the required action button on the appropriate list. Note that:

* Exception lists are exported to `.ndjson` files.
* Exception lists are also exported as part of any exported detection rules configured with exceptions. Refer to <<import-export-rules-ui>>.
* If an exception list is linked to any rules, you'll get a warning asking you to confirm the deletion. If no rules are linked, the list is deleted without confirmation.

You can add multiple exceptions to a single rule. An exception can also apply to multiple rules.

TIP: To find out if an exception is used by other rules, select the *Rule exceptions* or *Endpoint exceptions* tab, navigate to an exception list item, then click *Affects _X_ rules*.
