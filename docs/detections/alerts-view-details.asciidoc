NOTE: If you've configured the {kibana-ref}/settings.html#server-publicBaseUrl[`server.publicBaseUrl`] setting in the `kibana.yml` file, the shareable URL is also in the `kibana.alert.url` field. You can find the field by searching for `kibana.alert.url` on the *Table* tab.
+
IMPORTANT: If you've enabled grouping on the Alerts page, the expandable flyout won't open until you expand the collapsed group.

* Find basic details about the alert, such as the:
** Name of the rule associated with the alert
** Date and time that the alert was created
** Alert status and severity (these are inherited by the rule) 

* Click the **Table** or **JSON** tabs to display the alert details in table or JSON format. In table format, alert details are displayed as field-value pair. 
* Hover over fields on the *Overview* and *Table* tabs to display available <<inline-actions, inline actions>>.

[[entities-section]]
=== Entities 

The Entities section shows details about the host on which the event occurred and the user related to the event. Host and user risk classifications are generated if the <<host-risk-score,host>> and <<user-risk-score,user risk>> score features are enabled.   

NOTE: User and host risk scores are technical preview features and require a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum subscription] or higher. 

Click **Entities** to expand the **Entities** sub-tab in the left panel. The **Entities** sub-tab displays more information about the user and host, as well as their risk classifications.

[discrete]
[[threat-intelligence-section]]
=== Threat intelligence 

The Threat intelligence section shows contextually relevant threat intelligences that was discovered on the alert. Click **Threat intelligence** to expand the **Threat intelligence** sub-tab in the left panel. 

Within the **Threat intelligence** sub-tab, matched threats are organized into two sections: Threat Matched Detected and Enriched with Threat Intelligence. Matched threats are ordered in reverse chronological order, with the most recent at the top. All mapped fields are displayed for each matched threat.

The **Threat intelligence** sub-tab displays the following information:

* *Threat Matched Detected*: This section is solely reserved for threat indicator matches identified by an indicator match rule. Threat indicator matches are produced whenever event data matches a threat indicator field value in your indicator index. If indicator threat matches are not discovered, the section displays a message that none are available.
* *Enriched with Threat Intelligence*: This section shows indicator matches that {elastic-sec} found when querying the alert for fields with threat intelligence. You can use the date time picker to modify the query time frame, which looks at the past 30 days by default. Click the **Inspect** button, located on the far right of the threat label, to view more information on the query. If threat matches are not discovered within the selected time frame, the section displays a message that none are available.

NOTE: The event enrichment query uses the indices specified in the `securitySolution:defaultThreatIndex` advanced setting. For more information, refer to <<update-threat-intel-indices, Update default Elastic Security threat intelligence indices>>.

[[correlations-section]]
=== Correlations 

The Correlations section shows how an alert is related to other alerts and offers ways to investigate related alerts. Use this information to quickly find patterns between alerts and then take action. Click **Correlations** to expand the **Correlations** sub-tab in the left panel.

The Correlations sub-tab provides the following details:

* **Suppressed alerts**: Indicates that the alert was created with alert suppression, and shows how many duplicate alerts were suppressed. This section only appears if alert suppression is enabled for the rule.
* **Cases related to the alert**: Shows the total number and names of cases to which the alert has been added. Click a caseâ€™s name to open its details.
* **Alerts related by source event**: Shows the ten most recent alerts created by the same source event. This can help you find alerts with a shared origin and provide more context about the source event. Click the **Investigate in timeline** button to examine related alerts in Timeline.

[discrete]
[[prevalence-section]]
=== Prevalence

Shows the total number of alerts within the selected time frame that have identical values. For example, an alert prevalence of 3 for `host.name` means three alerts with the same `host.name` value exist within the time frame.

Alert prevalence data can help you investigate relationships with other alerts and gain context about the events producing alerts. You can also click the alert prevalence count to explore the alerts in Timeline.

IMPORTANT: Before investigating alert prevalence data in Timeline, save any Timelines you're working on to ensure you can access them later.
