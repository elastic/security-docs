[[entities-section]]
=== Entities 

The Entities section shows details about the user related to the alert and the host on which the alert was generated against.

If you have a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum subscription] or higher, you can find out the <<host-risk-score,host>> and <<user-risk-score,user risk>> scores. 

NOTE: User and host risk scores are technical preview features. 

Click **Entities** to expand the **Entities** sub-tab in the left panel. The **Entities** sub-tab displays more information about the user and host.

[discrete]
[[threat-intelligence-section]]
=== Threat intelligence 

The Threat intelligence section shows contextually relevant threat intelligence that was discovered on the alert. Click **Threat intelligence** to expand the **Threat intelligence** sub-tab in the left panel. 

Within the **Threat intelligence** sub-tab, matched threats are organized into two sections: Threat Matched Detected and Enriched with Threat Intelligence. Matched threats are ordered in reverse chronological order, with the most recent at the top. All mapped fields are displayed for each matched threat.

The **Threat intelligence** sub-tab displays the following information:

* *Threat Matched Detected*: This section is solely reserved for threat indicator matches identified by an indicator match rule. Threat indicator matches are produced whenever event data matches a threat indicator field value in your indicator index. If indicator threat matches are not discovered, the section displays a message that none are available.
* *Enriched with Threat Intelligence*: This section shows indicator matches that {elastic-sec} found when querying the alert for fields with threat intelligence. You can use the date time picker to modify the query time frame, which looks at the past 30 days by default. Click the **Inspect** button, located on the far right of the threat label, to view more information on the query. If threat matches are not discovered within the selected time frame, the section displays a message that none are available.

NOTE: The event enrichment query uses the indices specified in the `securitySolution:defaultThreatIndex` advanced setting. For more information, refer to <<update-threat-intel-indices, Update default Elastic Security threat intelligence indices>>.

[[correlations-section]]
=== Correlations 

The Correlations section shows how an alert is related to other alerts and offers ways to investigate related alerts. Use this information to quickly find patterns between alerts and then take action. Click **Correlations** to expand the **Correlations** sub-tab in the left panel. The sub-tab displays the following information: 

* **Suppressed alerts**: Indicates that the alert was created with alert suppression, and shows how many duplicate alerts were suppressed. This section only appears if alert suppression is enabled for the rule.
* **Alerts related by source event**: Shows the ten most recent alerts created by the same source event. This can help you find alerts with a shared origin and provide more context about the source event. Click the **Investigate in timeline** button to examine related alerts in Timeline.
* **Cases related to the alert**: Shows the total number and names of cases to which the alert has been added. Click a caseâ€™s name to open its details.

If you have a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or higher subscription], these details are also included:

* *Alerts related by session ID* - Shows the ten most recent alerts generated during the same <<session-view, session>>. These alerts share the same session ID, which is a unique ID for tracking a given Linux session. To use this feature, you must enable the *Include session data* setting in your {elastic-defend} integration policy. Refer to <<enable-session-view, Enable Session View data>> for more information.
* *Alerts related by process ancestry* - Shows alerts that are related by process events on the same linear branch. Note that alerts generated from processes on child or related branches are not shown. To further examine alerts, click *Investigate in timeline*.
