image::images/threat-intelligence-overview.png[Overview of threat intelligence on the alert, 70%]

The Threat intelligence overview provides the following information:

* **Threat match detected**: Only available when examining an alert generated from an <<create-indicator-rule,indicator match>> rule. Shows the number of matched indicators that are present in the alert document. Shows zero if there are no matched indicators or you're examining an alert generated by another type of rule.

* **Fields enriched with threat intelligence**: Shows the number of matched indicators that are present on an alert that _wasn't_ generated from an indicator match rule. If none exist, the total number of matched indicators is zero.

[discrete]
[[expanded-threat-intel-view]]
==== Expanded threat intelligence view

From the right panel, click **Threat intelligence** to open the expanded Threat intelligence view within the left panel. 

NOTE: The expanded threat intelligence view queries indices specified in the `securitySolution:defaultThreatIndex` advanced setting. Refer to <<update-threat-intel-indices, Update default Elastic Security threat intelligence indices>> to learn more about threat intelligence indices. 

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/expanded-threat-intelligence-view.png[Expanded view of threat intelligence on the alert, 70%]

The expanded Threat intelligence view shows individual indicators within the alert document. You can expand and collapse indicator details by clicking the arrow button at the end of the indicator label. Each indicator is labeled with values from the `matched.field` and `matched.atomic` fields and displays the threat intelligence provider. 

Matched threats are organized into two sections, described below. Within each section, matched threats are shown in reverse chronological order, with the most recent at the top. All mapped fields are displayed for each matched threat.

**Threat match detected**

The Threat match detected section is only populated with indicator match details if you're examining an alert that was generated from an indicator match rule. Indicator matches occur when alert field values match with threat intelligence data you've ingested. 

**Fields enriched with threat intelligence**

Threat intelligence can also be found on alerts that weren't generated from indicator match rules. To find this information, {elastic-sec} queries alert documents from the past 30 days and searches for fields that contain known threat intelligence. If any are found, they're logged in this section. 

TIP: Use the date time picker to modify the query time frame, which looks at the past 30 days by default. You can also click the **Inspect** button to examine the query that the Fields enriched with threat intelligence section uses.

When searching for threat intelligence, {elastic-sec} queries the alert document for the following fields:

- `file.hash.md5`: The MD5 hash
- `file.hash.sha1`: The SHA1 hash
- `file.hash.sha256`: The SHA256 hash
- `file.pe.imphash`: Imports in a PE file
- `file.elf.telfhash`: Imports in an ELF file
- `file.hash.ssdeep`: The SSDEEP hash
- `source.ip`: The IP address of the source (IPv4 or IPv6)
- `destination.ip`: The event's destination IP address
- `url.full`: The full URL of the event source
- `registry.path`: The full registry path, including the hive, key, and value

[[correlations-overview]]
=== Correlations 

The Correlations overview shows how an alert is related to other alerts and offers ways to investigate related alerts. Use this information to quickly find patterns between alerts and then take action. 

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/correlations-overview.png[Overview of available correlation data, 60%]

The Correlations overview provides the following information: 

* **Suppressed alerts**: Indicates that the alert was created with alert suppression, and shows how many duplicate alerts were suppressed. This information only appears if alert suppression is enabled for the rule.
* **Alerts related by source event**: Shows the number of alerts that were created by the same source event.  
* **Cases related to the alert**: Shows the number of cases to which the alert has been added.
* **Alerts related by session ID**: Shows the number of alerts generated by the same session. 
* **Alerts related by process ancestry**: Shows the number of alerts that are related by process events on the same linear branch. 
+
NOTE: To access data about alerts related by process ancestry, you must have a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or higher subscription].

[discrete]
[[expanded-correlations-view]]
==== Expanded correlations view

* **Suppressed alerts**: Shows how many duplicate alerts were suppressed. This information only appears if alert suppression is enabled for the rule.
+
preview::[]

* **Related cases**: Shows cases to which the alert has been added. Click a case's name to open its details.
* **Alerts related by source event**: Shows alerts created by the same source event. This can help you find alerts with a shared origin and provide more context about the source event. Click the *Investigate in timeline* button to examine related alerts in Timeline.
* **Alerts related by session**: Shows alerts generated during the same <<session-view, session>>. These alerts share the same session ID, which is a unique ID for tracking a given Linux session. To use this feature, you must enable the *Collect session data* setting in your {elastic-defend} integration policy. Refer to <<enable-session-view, Enable Session View data>> for more information.
* **Alerts related by ancestry**: Shows alerts that are related by process events on the same linear branch. Note that alerts generated from processes on child or related branches are not shown. To further examine alerts, click *Investigate in timeline*.

[discrete]
[[prevalence-overview]]
=== Prevalence

The Prevalence overview shows whether data from the alert was frequently observed on other host events from the last 30 days. Prevalence calculations use values from the alert’s highlighted fields. Highlighted field values that are observed on less than 10% of hosts in your environment are considered uncommon (not prevalent) and are listed individually in the Prevalence overview. Highlighted field values that are observed on more than 10% of hosts in your environment are considered common (prevalent) and are described as frequently observed in the Prevalence overview. 

[discrete]
[[expanded-prevalence-view]]
==== Expanded prevalence view

From the right panel, click **Prevalence** to open the expanded Prevalence view within the left panel. Examine the table to understand the alert's relationship with other alerts, events, users, and hosts.

TIP: Update the date time picker for the table to show data from a different time range. 

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/expanded-prevalence-view.png[Expanded view of prevalence data]

The expanded Prevalence view provides the following details:

* **Field**: Shows <<investigation-section,highlighted fields>> for the alert and any custom highlighted fields that were added to the alert's rule.

* **Value**: Shows values for highlighted fields and any custom highlighted fields that were added to the alert's rule.

* **Alert count**: Shows the total number of alert documents that have identical highlighted field values, including the alert you're currently examining. For example, if the `host.name` field has an alert count of 5, that means there are five total alerts with the same `host.name` value. The Alert count column only retrieves documents that contain the {ecs-ref}/ecs-allowed-values-event-kind.html#ecs-event-kind-signal[`event.kind:signal`] field-value pair.

* **Document count**: Shows the total number of event documents that have identical field values. A dash (`——`) displays if there are no event documents that match the field value. The Document count column only retrieves documents that don't contain the {ecs-ref}/ecs-allowed-values-event-kind.html#ecs-event-kind-signal[`event.kind:signal`] field-value pair.

The following features require a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum subscription] or higher:

* **Host prevalence**: Shows the percentage of unique hosts that have identical field values. Host prevalence for highlighted fields is calculated by taking the number of unique hosts with identical highlighted field values and dividing that number by the total number of unique hosts in your environment.  

* **User prevalence**: Shows the percentage of unique users that have identical highlighted field values. User prevalence for highlighted fields is calculated by taking the number of unique users with identical field values and dividing that number by the total number of unique users in your environment.
