[discrete]
[[entities-section]]
=== Entities 

The Entities sub-section shows the user related to the alert and the host on which the alert was generated against. <<host-risk-score,Host>> and <<user-risk-score,user risk>> scores are also available with a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum subscription] or higher. 

NOTE: User and host risk scores are technical preview features. 

Click **Entities** to expand the **Entities** sub-tab in the left panel. The **Entities** sub-tab displays more information about the user and host. 

[discrete]
[[threat-intelligence-section]]
=== Threat intelligence 

The Threat intelligence sub-section shows contextually relevant threat intelligence that was discovered on the alert. When gathering threat intelligence data for an alert, {elastic-sec} queries the alert for indicator matches from the past 30 days. The query looks for the following fields:

- `file.hash.md5`: The MD5 hash
- `file.hash.sha1`: The SHA1 hash
- `file.hash.sha256`: The SHA256 hash
- `file.pe.imphash`: Imports in a PE file
- `file.elf.telfhash`: Imports in an ELF file
- `file.hash.ssdeep`: The SSDEEP hash
- `source.ip`: The IP address of the source (IPv4 or IPv6)
- `destination.ip`: The event's destination IP address
- `url.full`: The full URL of the event source
- `registry.path`: The full registry path, including the hive, key, and value

If these fields aren't available, {elastic-sec} does not perform the query and does not display threat intelligence data for the alert.

Additional threat intelligence data is generated for indicator match alerts when indicators are matched with source events, as outlined by the conditions in the relevant indicator match rule. Indicator match alerts always populate the *Threat Matched Detected* section under the *Threat Intel* tab with additional threat match data.

Click **Threat intelligence** to expand the **Threat intelligence** sub-tab in the left panel. Within the sub-tab, matched threats are organized into two sections: <<threat-match-detected-section>> and <<enriched-with-threat-intelligence-section>>. Matched threats are ordered in reverse chronological order, with the most recent at the top. All mapped fields are displayed for each matched threat.

[discrete]
[[threat-match-detected-section]]
==== Threat match detected

The Threat match detected section is solely reserved for threat indicator matches identified by an indicator match rule. Threat indicator matches are produced whenever event data matches a threat indicator field value in your indicator index. If indicator threat matches are not discovered, the section displays a message that none are available.

[discrete]
[[enriched-with-threat-intelligence-section]]
==== Enriched with threat intelligence

The Enriched with threat intelligence section shows indicator matches that {elastic-sec} found when querying the alert for fields with threat intelligence. You can use the date time picker to modify the query time frame, which looks at the past 30 days by default. 

Click the **Inspect** button, located on the far right of the threat label, to view more information on the query. If threat matches are not discovered within the selected time frame, the section displays a message that none are available.

NOTE: The event enrichment query uses the indices specified in the `securitySolution:defaultThreatIndex` advanced setting. For more information, refer to <<update-threat-intel-indices, Update default Elastic Security threat intelligence indices>>.

[discrete]
[[correlations-section]]
=== Correlations 

The Correlations sub-section shows how an alert is related to other alerts and offers ways to investigate related alerts. Use this information to quickly find patterns between alerts and then take action. 

Click **Correlations** to expand the **Correlations** sub-tab in the left panel. The sub-tab displays the following information: 

* **Suppressed alerts**: Indicates that the alert was created with alert suppression, and shows how many duplicate alerts were suppressed. This section only appears if alert suppression is enabled for the rule.
* **Alerts related by source event**: Shows the ten most recent alerts created by the same source event. This can help you find alerts with a shared origin and provide more context about the source event. Click the **Investigate in timeline** button to examine related alerts in Timeline.
* **Cases related to the alert**: Shows the total number and names of cases to which the alert has been added. Click a case’s name to open its details.

If you have a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or higher subscription], these details are also included:

* **Alerts related by session ID**: Shows the ten most recent alerts generated during the same <<session-view, session>>. These alerts share the same session ID, which is a unique ID for tracking a given Linux session. To use this feature, you must enable the **Include session data** setting in your {elastic-defend} integration policy. Refer to <<enable-session-view, Enable Session View data>> for more information.
* **Alerts related by process ancestry**: Shows alerts that are related by process events on the same linear branch. Note that alerts generated from processes on child or related branches are not shown. To further examine alerts, click **Investigate in timeline**.

[discrete]
[[prevalence-section]]
=== Prevalence

The Prevalence sub-section shows how often data from the alert was observed on other host and user events. Prevalence calculations use data from the alert's highlighted fields and examine user and host events that occurred during the last 30 days. 

Click **Prevalence** to display the <<prevalence-sub-tab,Prevalence sub-tab>> in the left panel. 

[discrete]
[[prevalence-sub-tab]]
=== Prevalence sub-tab

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/prevalence-sub-tab.png[Table within the Prevalence sub-tab, 70%]

The following details are provided:

* **Field**: Shows the alert's highlighted fields.
* **Value**: Shows values from the alert's highlighted fields. 
* **Alert count**: Shows the total number of alert documents that have identical field-value pairs, including the alert you're currently examining. 
+
NOTE: Queries for the **Alert count** column only retrieve alert documents that have the `event.kind:signal` field-value pair.  
* **Document count**: Shows the total number of event documents that contain identical field-value pairs. A dash (`--`) displays if there are zero event documents that contains the field-value pair.
+
NOTE: Queries for the **Document count** column only retrieve alert documents that do not have the `event.kind:signal` field-value pair.  
* **Host prevalence**: Shows the percentage of unique hosts that have identical field-value pairs.  
* **User prevalence**: Shows the percentage of unique users that have identical field-value pairs.
