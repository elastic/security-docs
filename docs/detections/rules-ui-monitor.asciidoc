== Monitor and troubleshoot rule executions

To view a summary of all rule executions, such as failures and last execution
times, select the *Rule Monitoring* tab on the *Rules* page (*Detect* ->
*Rules* -> *Rule Monitoring*).

For detailed information on a rule, its generated alerts, and its errors, click on
a rule name in the *All rules* table.

=== Troubleshoot missing alerts

When a rule fails to run close to its scheduled time, some alerts may be
missing. There are a number of factors you can troubleshoot to try to resolve this issue:

* <<troubleshoot-gaps>>
* <<troubleshoot-ingestion-pipeline-delay>>
* <<ml-job-compatibility>>

You can also use Task Manager in {kib} to troubleshoot background tasks and processes that may be related to missing alerts:

* {kibana-ref}/task-manager-health-monitoring.html[Task Manager health monitoring]
* {kibana-ref}/task-manager-troubleshooting.html[Task Manager troubleshooting]

[[troubleshoot-gaps]]
==== Troubleshoot gaps

If you see values in the Gaps column in the All rules table or on the Rule details page
for a small number of rules, you can increase those rules'
Additional look-back time (*Detect* -> *Rules* -> the rule's *All actions* button (*...*) -> *Edit rule settings* -> *Schedule* -> *Additional look-back time*).

NOTE: If the rule that experiences gaps is an indicator match rule, see <<tune-indicator-rules, how to tune indicator match rules>>. Also please note that {es-sec} provides <<support-indicator-rules, limited support for indicator match rules>>.

If you see gaps for numerous rules:

* If you restarted {kib} when many rules were activated, try deactivating them
and then reactivating them in small batches at staggered intervals. This
ensures {kib} does not attempt to run all the rules at the same time.
* Consider adding another {kib} instance to your environment.

[[troubleshoot-ingestion-pipeline-delay]]
==== Troubleshoot ingestion pipeline delay

Even if your rule runs at its scheduled time, there might still be missing alerts if your ingestion pipeline delay is greater than your rule interval + additional look-back time. Prebuilt rules have a minimum interval + additional look-back time of 6 minutes in {stack} version >=7.11.0. To avoid missed alerts for prebuilt rules, use caution to ensure that ingestion pipeline delays remain below 6 minutes.

In addition, use caution when creating custom rule schedules to ensure that the specified interval + additional look-back time is greater than your deployment's ingestion pipeline delay.

You can mitigate the risk of missed alerts due to ingestion pipeline delay by specifying the `Timestamp override` field value to `event.ingested` in <<rule-ui-advanced-params, advanced settings>> during rule creation or editing. The detection engine uses the value from the `event.ingested` field as the timestamp when executing the rule.

For example, let's assume an event occurred at 10:00, but it wasn't ingested into {es} until 10:10 due to an ingestion pipeline delay. If we've created a rule to detect that event with an interval + additional look-back time of 6 minutes, and the rule executes at 10:12, it would still detect the event because the `event.ingested` timestamp was from 10:10, only 2 minutes before the rule executed and well within the rule's 6-minute interval + additional look-back time.

[[ml-job-compatibility]]
==== Troubleshoot missing alerts for {ml} jobs

The <<prebuilt-ml-jobs,prebuilt {ml} jobs>> have dependencies on data fields
that are populated by {beats} and {agent} integrations. In version 7.11, new
{ml} jobs (<<security-linux-jobs>> and <<security-windows-jobs>>) were provided,
which operate on newer ECS fields than the previous
<<security-winlogbeat-jobs>> and <<security-auditbeat-jobs>> jobs. However, the
<<prebuilt-rules,prebuilt rules>> were not updated to use the new {ml} jobs.

Therefore:

* If you have only 7.10 or earlier versions of {beats}, you can continue using
the Security:Auditbeat and Security:Winlogbeat {ml} jobs and the prebuilt {ml}
rules that have been in the {security-app} since version 7.5.
* If you have only 7.11 or later versions of {beats}, use the Security:Linux and
Security:Windows {ml} jobs. If you want to generate alerts for anomalies in
these jobs, make clones of the existing {ml} rules and update them to use the
new jobs.
* If you have a mix of old and new versions of {beats} or you have a mix of
{beats} and {elastic-endpoint} integrations, use both the old and new {ml} jobs.
If you want alerts for anomalies in the new jobs, make clones of the existing
{ml} rules and update them to use the new jobs.
* If you have a non-Elastic data shipper that gathers ECS-compatible Windows
events, use the Security:Windows {ml} jobs. If you want alerts for anomalies in
these jobs, make clones of the existing {ml} rules and update them to use these
jobs.

If you are cloning prebuilt {ml} rules to generate alerts for the new {ml} jobs,
the following rules are affected:

* <<unusual-linux-network-port-activity>>: Use
`v2_linux_anomalous_network_port_activity_ecs` instead of
`linux_anomalous_network_port_activity_ecs`.
* <<anomalous-process-for-a-linux-population>>: Use
`v2_linux_anomalous_process_all_hosts_ecs` instead of
`linux_anomalous_process_all_hosts_ecs`.
* <<unusual-linux-username>>: Use `v2_linux_anomalous_user_name_ecs` instead of
`linux_anomalous_user_name_ecs`.
* <<unusual-linux-process-calling-the-metadata-service>>: Use
`v2_linux_rare_metadata_process` instead of `linux_rare_metadata_process`.
* <<unusual-linux-user-calling-the-metadata-service>>: Use
`v2_linux_rare_metadata_user` instead of `linux_rare_metadata_user`.
* <<unusual-process-for-a-linux-host>>: Use `v2_rare_process_by_host_linux_ecs`
instead of `rare_process_by_host_linux_ecs`.
* <<unusual-process-for-a-windows-host>>: Use
`v2_rare_process_by_host_windows_ecs` instead of
`rare_process_by_host_windows_ecs`.
* <<unusual-windows-network-activity>>: Use
`v2_windows_anomalous_network_activity_ecs` instead of
`windows_anomalous_network_activity_ecs`.
* <<unusual-windows-path-activity>>: Use `v2_windows_anomalous_path_activity_ecs`
instead of `windows_anomalous_path_activity_ecs`.
* <<anomalous-windows-process-creation>>: Use
`v2_windows_anomalous_process_creation` instead of
`windows_anomalous_process_creation`.
* <<anomalous-process-for-a-windows-population>>: Use
`v2_windows_anomalous_process_all_hosts_ecs` instead of
`windows_anomalous_process_all_hosts_ecs`.
* <<unusual-windows-username>>: Use `v2_windows_anomalous_user_name_ecs` instead
of `windows_anomalous_user_name_ecs`.
* <<unusual-windows-process-calling-the-metadata-service>>: Use
`v2_windows_rare_metadata_process` instead of `windows_rare_metadata_process`.
* <<unusual-windows-user-calling-the-metadata-service>>: Use
`v2_windows_rare_metadata_user` instead of `windows_rare_metadata_user`.
