== Monitoring and troubleshooting rule executions

To view a summary of all rule executions, such as failures and last execution
times, select the *Rule Monitoring* tab in the *All rules* table (*Security* ->
*Detections* -> *Manage detection rules*).

For detailed information on a rule, its generated alerts and errors, click on
a rule name in the *All rules* table.

=== Troubleshoot missing alerts

When a rule fails to run close to its scheduled time, some alerts may be
missing. There are a number of steps you can perform to try and resolve this
issue.

If you see `Gaps` in the All rules table or on the Rule details page
for a small number of rules, you can increase those rules'
`Additional look-back time` (*Detection rules* page -> the rule's *All actions* button (*...*) -> *Edit rule settings* -> *Schedule* -> _Additional look-back time_).

If you see gaps for numerous rules:

* If you restarted {kib} when many rules were activated, try deactivating them
and then reactivating them in small batches at staggered intervals. This
ensures {kib} does not attempt to run all the rules at the same time.
* Consider adding another {kib} instance to your environment.

Even if your rule runs at its scheduled time, there might still be missing alerts if your ingestion pipeline delay is greater than your rule interval + additional look-back time. Prebuilt rules have a minimum interval + additional look-back time of 6 minutes in {stack} version >=7.11.0. To avoid missed alerts for prebuilt rules, use caution to ensure that ingestion pipeline delays remain below 6 minutes.

In addition, use caution when creating custom rule schedules to ensure that the specified interval + additional look-back time is greater than your deployment's ingestion pipeline delay.

You can eliminate the risk of missed alerts due to ingestion pipeline delay by specifying the `Timestamp override` field value to `event.ingested` in <<rule-ui-advanced-params, advanced settings>> during rule creation or editing. The detection engine uses the value from the `event.ingested` field as the timestamp when executing the rule.

For example, if an event occurred at 10:01, and due to a 9-minute ingestion pipeline delay, was ingested into {es} at 10:10, a rule created to detect that event, with an interval + additional look-back time of 6 minutes, even if executing at 10:12 -- 11 minutes after the event occurred -- would still detect the event since the `event.ingested` timestamp was only two minutes earlier, well within the 6-minute rule query.
