=== Troubleshoot missing alerts

When a rule fails to run close to its scheduled time, some alerts may be
missing. There are a number of steps you can perform to try and resolve this
issue.

If you see `Gaps` in the All rules table or on the Rule details page
for a small number of rules, you can increase those rules'
`Additional look-back time` (*Detection rules* page -> the rule's *All actions* button (*...*) -> *Edit rule settings* -> *Schedule* -> _Additional look-back time_).

If you see gaps for numerous rules:

* If you restarted {kib} when many rules were activated, try deactivating them
and then reactivating them in small batches at staggered intervals. This
ensures {kib} does not attempt to run all the rules at the same time.
* Consider adding another {kib} instance to your environment.
