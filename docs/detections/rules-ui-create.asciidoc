== Create a detection rule

Rules run periodically and search for source events, matches, sequences, or {ml} job anomaly results
that meet their criteria. When a rule's criteria are met, a detection alert is
created.

You can create the following types of rules:

* <<create-custom-rule, *Custom query*>>: Query-based rule, which searches the defined indices and
creates an alert when one or more documents match the rule's query.
* <<create-ml-rule, *Machine learning>>*: {ml-cap} rule, which creates an alert when a {ml} job
discovers an anomaly above the defined threshold (see <<machine-learning>>).
+
For {ml} rules, the associated {ml} job must be running. If the {ml} job is not
running, the rule will:

** Run and create alerts if existing anomaly results with scores above the defined threshold
are discovered.
** Issue an error stating the {ml} job was not running when the rule executed.
* <<create-threshold-rule, *Threshold*>>: Searches the defined indices and creates a detections alert
when the number of times the specified field's value is present and meets the threshold during
a single execution. When multiple values meet the threshold, an alert is
generated for each value.
+
For example, if the threshold `field` is `source.ip` and its `value` is `10`, an
alert is generated for every source IP address that appears in at least 10 of
the rule's search results.
* <<create-eql-rule, *Event correlation*>>: Searches the defined indices and creates an alert when results match an
{ref}/eql.html[Event Query Language (EQL)] query.
* <<create-indicator-rule, *Indicator match*>>: Creates an alert when {elastic-sec} index field values match field values defined in the specified indicator index patterns. For example, you can create an indicator index for IP addresses and use this index to create an alert whenever an event's `destination.ip` equals a value in the index. Indicator index field mappings should be {ecs-ref}[ECS-compliant]. For information on creating {es} indices and field types, see
{ref}/getting-started-index.html[Index some documents],
{ref}/indices-create-index.html[Create index API], and
{ref}/mapping-types.html[Field data types]. If you have indicators in a standard file format, such as CSV or JSON, you can also use the Machine Learning Data Visualizer to import your indicators into an indicator index. See {ml-docs}/ml-getting-started.html#sample-data-visualizer[Explore the data in {kib}] and use the *Import Data* option to import your indicators.
+
TIP: You can also use value lists as the indicator match index. See <<indicator-value-lists>> at the end of this topic for more information.

* <<create-new-terms-rule, *New terms*>>: Generates an alert for each new term detected in source documents within a specified time range.

When modifying rules or managing detection alerts, you can <<add-exceptions,add exceptions>> that prevent a rule from generating alerts even when its criteria are met. This is useful for reducing noise, such as preventing alerts from trusted processes and internal IP addresses.

NOTE: You can add exceptions to custom query, machine learning, event correlation, and indicator match rule types.

For both prebuilt and custom rules, you can send notifications when alerts are created. Notifications can be sent via {jira}, Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty, Slack, and others, and can be configured when you create or edit a rule.

Creating a new rule requires the following steps:

. <<create-rule-ui>>
. <<rule-ui-basic-params>>
. <<rule-ui-advanced-params>>
. <<rule-schedule>>
. <<rule-notifications>>
. <<rule-response-action>>

At any step, you can <<preview-rules,preview the rule>> before saving it to see what kind of results you can expect.

[IMPORTANT]
==============
After you activate a rule, you can check if it is running as expected
using the <<alerts-ui-monitor, Monitoring tab>> on the Rules page. If you see
values in the `Gap` column, you can <<troubleshoot-signals>>.

When a rule fails to run, the {security-app} tries to rerun it at its next
scheduled run time.
==============

[float]
[[alerting-authorization-model]]
=== Authorization

Rules, including all background detection and the actions they generate, are authorized using an {kibana-ref}/api-keys.html[API key] associated with the last user to edit the rule. Upon creating or modifying a rule, an API key is generated for that user, capturing a snapshot of their privileges. The API key is then used to run all background tasks associated with the rule including detection checks and executing actions.

[IMPORTANT]
==============================================
If a rule requires certain privileges to run, such as index privileges, keep in mind that if a user without those privileges updates the rule, the rule will no longer function.
==============================================

[float]
[[views-index-patterns]]
=== Data views and index patterns

When you create a rule, you must either specify the {es} index pattens for which you'd like the rule to run, or select a {kibana-ref}/data-views.html[data view] as the data source. If you select a data view, you can select <<runtime-fields, runtime fields>> associated with that data view to create a query for the rule (with the exception of {ml} rules, which do not use queries).

NOTE: To access data views, ensure you have the {kibana-ref}/data-views.html#data-views-read-only-access[required permissions].

[float]
[[create-rule-ui]]
=== Select rule type and scope

. Go to *Manage* -> *Rules* -> *Create new rule*. The *Create new rule* page displays.

. Select the type of rule you want to create, then follow the steps outlined in that section:

* <<create-ml-rule, Machine learning>>
* <<create-custom-rule, Custom query>>
* <<create-threshold-rule, Threshold>>
* <<create-eql-rule, Event correlation>>

[discrete]
[[create-ml-rule]]
==== Create a machine learning rule

[IMPORTANT]
==============
To create or edit {ml} rules, you must have the https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license] or use a
{ess-trial}[cloud deployment]. Additionally, you must have the {ref}/built-in-roles.html[`machine_learning_admin`] user
role, and the selected {ml} job must be running for the rule to function correctly.
==============

. To create a rule based on a {ml} anomaly threshold, select *Machine Learning*,
then select:
.. The required {ml} job(s).
.. The anomaly score threshold above which alerts are created.
. Make sure that the {ml} jobs required for the rule are running. If a required {ml} job is not running, an alert is displayed.
.. Select **ML job settings** in the upper-right corner of the page, then search for the required {ml} job.
.. Turn on the **Run job** switch for the required {ml} job.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/rule-start-ml-job.png[Turning on a machine learning job in the ML job settings menu,75%]
+
. Click **Continue** to <<rule-ui-basic-params, configure basic rule settings>>.

[discrete]
[[create-custom-rule]]
==== Create a custom query rule
. To create a rule based on a KQL or Lucene query, select *Custom query*,
then:
.. Define which {es} indices or data view the rule searches for alerts.
.. Use the filter and query fields to create the criteria used for detecting
alerts.
+
The following example (based on the prebuilt rule <<prebuilt-rule-0-14-2-volume-shadow-copy-deleted-or-resized-via-vssadmin, Volume Shadow Copy Deleted or Resized via VssAdmin>>) detects when the `vssadmin delete shadows`
Windows command is executed:

** *Index patterns*: `winlogbeat-*`
+
Winlogbeat ships Windows event logs to {elastic-sec}.

** *Custom query*: `event.action:"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)" and process.name:"vssadmin.exe" and process.args:("delete" and "shadows")`
+
Searches the `winlogbeat-*` indices for `vssadmin.exe` executions with
the `delete` and `shadow` arguments, which are used to delete a volume's shadow
copies.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/rule-query-example.png[Rule query example]

.. You can use {kib} saved queries (image:images/saved-query-menu.png[Saved query menu,18,18]) and queries from saved Timelines (*Import query from saved Timeline*) as rule conditions.
+
When you use a saved query, the *Load saved query "_query name_" dynamically on each rule execution* check box appears:

* Select this to use the saved query every time the rule runs. This links the rule to the saved query, and you won't be able to modify the rule's *Custom query* field or filters because the rule will only use settings from the saved query. To make changes, modify the saved query itself.

* Deselect this to load the saved query as a one-time way of populating the rule's *Custom query* field and filters. This copies the settings from the saved query to the rule, so you can then further adjust the rule's query and filters as needed. If the saved query is later changed, the rule will not inherit those changes.

. preview:[] (Optional, https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or higher subscription] required) Use *Suppress Alerts By* to reduce the number of repeated or duplicate alerts created. Enter a field name to group matching source events by the field's unique values, and only one alert will be created for each group of events. You can also enter multiple fields to group events by unique combinations of values.
+
You'll still be able to view the original events for suppressed alerts by investigating the alert in Timeline. Refer to <<alert-suppression>> for more information.

. Click **Continue** to <<rule-ui-basic-params, configure basic rule settings>>.

[discrete]
[[create-threshold-rule]]
==== Create a threshold rule
. To create a rule based on a source event field threshold, select *Threshold*, then:
.. Define which {es} indices the rule analyzes for alerts.
.. Use the filter and query fields to create the criteria used for detecting
alerts.
+
NOTE: You can use {kib} saved queries (image:images/saved-query-menu.png[Saved query menu,18,18]) and queries from saved Timelines (*Import query from saved Timeline*) as rule conditions.

.. Use the `Group by` and `Threshold` fields to determine which source event field is used as a threshold and the threshold's value.
.. Use the `Count` field to limit alerts by cardinality of a certain field.
+
For example, if `Group by` is `source.ip`, `destination.ip` and its `Threshold` is `10`, an alert is generated for every pair of source and destination IP addresses that appear in at least 10 of the rule's search results.
+
You can also leave the `Group by` field undefined. The rule then creates an alert when the number of search results is equal to or greater than the threshold value. If you set `Count` to limit the results by `process.name` >= 2, an alert will only be generated for source/destination IP pairs that appear with at least 2 unique process names across all events.
+
IMPORTANT: Alerts created by threshold rules are synthetic alerts that do not resemble the source documents. The alert itself only contains data about the fields that were aggregated over (the `Group by` fields). Other fields are omitted, because they can vary across all source documents that were counted toward the threshold. Additionally, you can reference the actual count of documents that exceeded the threshold from the `kibana.alert.threshold_result.count` field.

. Click *Continue* to <<rule-ui-basic-params, configure basic rule settings>>.

[discrete]
[[create-eql-rule]]
==== Create an event correlation rule
. To create an event correlation rule using EQL, select *Event Correlation*, then:
.. Define which {es} indices or data view the rule searches for alerts.
.. Add an {ref}/eql-syntax.html[EQL statement] used to detect alerts.
+
For example, the following rule detects when `msxsl.exe` makes an outbound
network connection:
+
** *Index patterns*: `winlogbeat-*`
+
Winlogbeat ships Windows events to {elastic-sec}.

** *EQL query*:
+
[source,eql]
----
sequence by process.entity_id
  [process
    where event.type in ("start", "process_started")
    and process.name == "msxsl.exe"]
  [network
    where event.type == "connection"
    and process.name == "msxsl.exe"
    and network.direction == "outgoing"]
----
+
Searches the `winlogbeat-*` indices for sequences of a `msxsl.exe` process start
event followed by an outbound network connection event that was started by the
`msxsl.exe` process.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/eql-rule-query-example.png[]
+
NOTE: For sequence events, the {security-app} generates a single alert when all events listed in the sequence are detected. To see the matched sequence events in more detail, you can view the alert in the Timeline, and, if all events came from the same process, open the alert in Analyze Event view.
+
. (Optional) Click the EQL settings icon (image:images/eql-settings-icon.png[EQL settings icon,16,16]) to configure additional fields used by {ref}/eql.html#specify-a-timestamp-or-event-category-field[EQL search]:
  * *Event category field*: Contains the event classification, such as `process`, `file`, or `network`. This field is typically mapped as a field type in the {ref}/keyword.html[keyword family]. Defaults to the `event.category` ECS field.
  * *Tiebreaker field*: Sets a secondary field for sorting events (in ascending, lexicographic order) if they have the same timestamp.
  * *Timestamp field*: Contains the event timestamp used for sorting a sequence of events. This is different from the *Timestamp override* advanced setting, which is used for querying events within a range. Defaults to the `@timestamp` ECS field.
+
. Click *Continue* to <<rule-ui-basic-params, configure basic rule settings>>.

[discrete]
[[create-indicator-rule]]
==== Create an indicator match rule

NOTE: {elastic-sec} provides limited support for indicator match rules. See <<support-indicator-rules>> for more information.

. To create a rule that searches for events whose specified field value matches the specified indicator field value in the indicator index patterns, select *Indicator Match*, then fill in the following fields:
.. *Source*: The individual index patterns or data view that specifies what data to search.
.. *Custom query*: The query and filters used to retrieve the required results from
the {elastic-sec} event indices. For example, if you want to match documents that only contain a `destination.ip` address field, add `destination.ip : *`.
+
TIP: If you want the rule to check every field in the indices, use this
wildcard expression: `*:*`.
+
NOTE: You can use {kib} saved queries (image:images/saved-query-menu.png[Saved query menu,18,18]) and queries from saved Timelines (*Import query from saved Timeline*) as rule conditions.

.. *Indicator index patterns*: The indicator index patterns containing field values for which you want to generate alerts. This field is automatically populated with indices specified in the `securitySolution:defaultThreatIndex` advanced setting. For more information, see <<update-threat-intel-indices, Update default Elastic Security threat intelligence indices>>.
+
IMPORTANT: Data in indicator indices must be <<ecs-compliant-reqs, ECS compatible>>, and so it must contain a `@timestamp` field.
+
.. *Indicator index query*: The query and filters used to filter the fields from
the indicator index patterns. The default query `@timestamp > "now-30d/d"` searches specified indicator indices for indicators ingested during the past 30 days and rounds the start time down to the nearest day (resolves to UTC `00:00:00`).
.. *Indicator mapping*: Compares the values of the specified event and indicator field
values. When the field values are identical, an alert is generated. To define
which field values are compared from the indices add the following:
** *Field*: The field used for comparing values in the {elastic-sec} event
indices.
** *Indicator index field*: The field used for comparing values in the indicator
indices.
.. You can add `AND` and `OR` clauses to define when alerts are generated.
+
For example, to create a rule that generates alerts when `host.name` *and*
`destination.ip` field values in the `logs-*` or `packetbeat-*` {elastic-sec} indices
are identical to the corresponding field values in the `mock-threat-list` indicator
index, enter the rule parameters seen in the following image:
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/indicator-rule-example.png[Indicator match rule settings]
+
TIP: Before you create rules, create <<timelines-ui, Timeline templates>> so
they can be selected here. When alerts generated by the rule are investigated
in the Timeline, Timeline query values are replaced with their corresponding alert
field values.
+
. Click *Continue* to <<rule-ui-basic-params, configure basic rule settings>>.

[discrete]
[[create-new-terms-rule]]
==== Create a new terms rule

. To create a rule that searches for each new term detected in source documents, select *New Terms*, then:
.. Specify what data to search by entering individual {es} index patterns or selecting an existing data view.
.. Use the filter and query fields to create the criteria used for detecting
alerts.
+
NOTE: You can use {kib} saved queries (image:images/saved-query-menu.png[Saved query menu,18,18]) and queries from saved Timelines (*Import query from saved Timeline*) as rule conditions.
+
.. Use the *Fields* menu to select a field to check for new terms.
.. Use the *History Window Size* menu to specify the time range to search in minutes, hours, or days to determine if a term is new. The history window size must be larger than the rule interval plus additional look-back time, because the rule will look for terms where the only time(s) the term appears within the history window is _also_ within the rule interval and additional look-back time.
+
For example, if a rule has an interval of 5 minutes, no additional look-back time, and a history window size of 7 days, a term will be considered new only if the time it appears within the last 7 days is also within the last 5 minutes. Configure the rule interval and additional look-back time when you <<rule-schedule, set the rule's schedule>>.
. Click *Continue* to <<rule-ui-basic-params, configure basic rule settings>>.

[discrete]
[[preview-rules]]
=== Preview your rule (optional)

You can preview any custom or prebuilt rule to find out how noisy it will be. For a custom rule, you can then adjust the rule's query or other settings.

NOTE: To preview rules, you need the `read` privilege to the `.preview.alerts-security.alerts-<space-id>` index and `All` privileges for the Security feature. Refer to <<detections-permissions-section>> for more information.

Click the *Rule preview* button while creating or editing a rule. The preview opens in a side panel, showing a histogram and table with the alerts you can expect, based on the defined rule settings and past events in your indices. 

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/preview-rule.png[Rule preview]

The preview also includes the effects of rule exceptions and override fields. In the histogram, alerts are stacked by `event.category` (or `host.name` for machine learning rules), and alerts with multiple values are counted more than once.

To interact with the rule preview:

* Use the date and time picker to define the preview's time range.
+
TIP: Avoid setting long time ranges with short rule intervals, or the rule preview might time out.

* Click *Refresh* to update the preview. 
** When you edit the rule's settings or the preview's time range, the button changes from blue (image:images/rule-preview-refresh-circle.png[Blue circular refresh icon,16,17]) to green (image:images/rule-preview-refresh-arrow.png[Green right-pointing arrow refresh icon,17,17]) to indicate that the rule has been edited since the last preview.
** For a relative time range (such as `Last 1 hour`), refresh the preview to check for the latest results. (Previews don't automatically refresh with new incoming data.)

* Click the *View details* icon (image:images/view-details-icon.png[View details icon,16,15]) in the alerts table to view the details of a particular alert.

[float]
[[rule-ui-basic-params]]
=== Configure basic rule settings

. In the **About rule** pane, fill in the following fields:
.. *Name*: The rule's name.
.. *Description*: A description of what the rule does.
.. *Default severity*: Select the severity level of alerts created by the rule:
* *Low*: Alerts that are of interest but generally are not considered to be
security incidents. Sometimes a combination of low severity alerts can
indicate suspicious activity.
* *Medium*: Alerts that require investigation.
* *High*: Alerts that require an immediate investigation.
* *Critical*: Alerts that indicate it is highly likely a security incident has
occurred.
.. *Severity override* (optional): Select to use source event values to
override the *Default severity* in generated alerts. When selected, a UI
component is displayed where you can map the source event field values to
severity levels. The following example shows how to map severity levels to `host.name`
values:
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/severity-mapping-ui.png[]
+
NOTE: For threshold rules, not all source event values can be used for overrides; only the fields that were aggregated over (the `Group by` fields) will contain data. Please also note that overrides are not supported for event correlation rules.
.. *Default risk score*: A numerical value between 0 and 100 that indicates the risk of events detected by the rule. This setting changes to a default value when you change the *Severity* level, but you can adjust the risk score as needed. General guidelines are:
* `0` - `21` represents low severity.
* `22` - `47` represents medium severity.
* `48` - `73` represents high severity.
* `74` - `100` represents critical severity.
.. *Risk score override* (optional): Select to use a source event value to
override the *Default risk score* in generated alerts. When selected, a UI
component is displayed to select the source field used for the risk
score. For example, if you want to use the source event's risk score in
alerts:
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/risk-source-field-ui.png[]
+
NOTE: For threshold rules, not all source event values can be used for overrides; only the fields that were aggregated over (the `Group by` fields) will contain data.
.. *Tags* (optional): Words and phrases used to categorize, filter, and search
the rule.

. Continue with *one* of the following:

* <<rule-ui-advanced-params>>
* <<rule-schedule>>

[float]
[[rule-ui-advanced-params]]
=== Configure advanced rule settings (optional)

. Click *Advanced settings* and fill in the following fields where applicable:
.. *Reference URLs* (optional): References to information that is relevant to
the rule. For example, links to background information.
.. *False positive examples* (optional): List of common scenarios that may produce
false-positive alerts.
.. *MITRE ATT&CK^TM^ threats* (optional): Add relevant https://attack.mitre.org/[MITRE] framework tactics, techniques, and subtechniques.
.. *Investigation guide* (optional): Information for analysts investigating
alerts created by the rule.
.. *Author* (optional): The rule's authors.
.. *License* (optional): The rule's license.
.. *Elastic endpoint exceptions* (optional): Adds all Elastic Endpoint Security
rule exceptions to this rule (refer to <<endpoint-rule-exceptions>> to learn more about adding endpoint exceptions).
+
NOTE: If you select this option, you can add
<<endpoint-rule-exceptions, Endpoint exceptions>> on the Rule details page.
Additionally, all future exceptions added to the Endpoint Security rule
also affect this rule.
+

.. *Building block* (optional): Select to create a building-block rule. By
default, alerts generated from a building-block rule are not displayed in the
UI. See <<building-block-rule>> for more information.
.. *Indicator prefix override*: Define the location of indicator data within the structure of indicator documents. When the indicator match rule executes, it queries specified indicator indices and references this setting to locate fields with indicator data. This data is used to enrich indicator match alerts with metadata about matched threat indicators. The default value for this setting is `threat.indicator`.
+
IMPORTANT: If your threat indicator data is at a different location, update this setting accordingly to ensure alert enrichment can still be performed.

.. *Rule name override* (optional): Select a source event field to use as the
rule name in the UI (Alerts table). This is useful for exposing, at a glance,
more information about an alert. For example, if the rule generates alerts from
Suricata, selecting `event.action` lets you see what action (Suricata category)
caused the event directly in the Alerts table.
+
NOTE: For threshold rules, not all source event values can be used for overrides; only the fields that were aggregated over (the `Group by` fields) will contain data.
.. *Timestamp override* (optional): Select a source event timestamp field. When selected, the rule's query uses the selected field, instead of the default `@timestamp` field, to search for alerts. This can help reduce missing alerts due to network or server outages. Specifically, if your ingest pipeline adds a timestamp when events are sent to {es}, this avoids missing alerts due to ingestion delays.
However, if you know your data source has an inaccurate `@timestamp` value, it is recommended you select the *Do not use @timestamp as a fallback timestamp field* option to ignore the `@timestamp` field entirely.
+
TIP: The {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-microsoft.html[Microsoft] and
{filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-google_workspace.html[Google Workspace] {filebeat} modules have an `event.ingested` timestamp field that can be used instead of the default `@timestamp` field.

. Click *Continue*. The *Schedule rule* pane is displayed.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/schedule-rule.png[]

. Continue with <<rule-schedule, setting the rule's schedule>>.

[float]
[[rule-schedule]]
=== Set the rule's schedule

. Select how often the rule runs.
. Optionally, add `Additional look-back time` to the rule. When defined, the
rule searches indices with the additional time.
+
For example, if you set a rule to run every 5 minutes with an additional
look-back time of 1 minute, the rule runs every 5 minutes but analyzes the
documents added to indices during the last 6 minutes.
+
[IMPORTANT]
==============
It is recommended to set the `Additional look-back time` to at
least 1 minute. This ensures there are no missing alerts when a rule does not
run exactly at its scheduled time.

{elastic-sec} prevents duplication. Any duplicate alerts that are discovered during the
`Additional look-back time` are _not_ created.
==============
. Click *Continue*. The *Rule actions* pane is displayed.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/rule-actions.png[]

. Do either of the following:

* Continue onto <<rule-notifications, setting up alert notifications>> and <<rule-response-action, Response Actions>> (optional).
* Create the rule (with or without activation).

[float]
[[rule-notifications]]
=== Set up alert notifications (optional)

Use {kib} Actions to set up notifications sent via other systems when alerts
are generated.

NOTE: To use {kib} Actions for alert notifications, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license] and your role needs *All* privileges for the *Action and Connectors* feature. For more information, see <<case-permissions>>.

. Set when to send notifications:

* *On each rule execution*: Sends a notification every time new alerts are
generated.
* *Hourly*: Sends a notification every hour.
* *Daily*: Sends a notification every day.
* *Weekly*: Sends a notification every week.
+
NOTE: Notifications are sent only when new alerts are generated.
+
The available connector types are displayed.
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/available-action-types.png[Shows available connector types]

. Select the required connector type, which determines how notifications are sent. For example, if you select the {jira} connector, notifications are sent to your {jira} system.
+
NOTE: Each action type requires a connector. Connectors store the
information required to send the notification from the external system. You can
configure connectors while creating the rule or on the {kib} Rules and Connectors
page (*Stack Management* -> *Rules and Connectors* -> *Connectors*). For more
information, see {kibana-ref}/action-types.html[Action and connector types].
+
The selected connector type fields are displayed ({jira} example).
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/selected-action-type.png[]
+
. Fill in the fields for the selected connector types. For all connector types, click
the icon above the `Message` field to add
<<rule-action-variables, placeholders>> for rule and alert details to the
notifications.
+
. Create the rule with or without activation.
+
NOTE: When you activate a rule, it is queued, and its schedule is determined by
its initial run time. For example, if you activate a rule that runs every 5
minutes at 14:03 but it does not run until 14:04, it will run again at 14:09.

[float]

* `{{context.rule.threat}}`: Rule threat framework
* `{{context.rule.threshold}}`: Rule threshold values (threshold rules only)
* `{{context.rule.timeline_id}}`: Associated Timeline ID
* `{{context.rule.timeline_title}}`: Associated Timeline name
* `{{context.rule.type}}`: Rule type
* `{{context.rule.version}}`: Rule version
* `{{date}}``: Date the rule scheduled the action
* `{{kibanaBaseUrl}}`: Configured `server.publicBaseUrl` value, or empty string if not configured
* `{{rule.id}}`: ID of the rule
* `{{rule.name}}`: Name of the rule
* `{{rule.spaceId}}`: Space ID of the rule
* `{{rule.tags}}`: Tags of the rule
* `{{rule.type}}`: Type of rule
* `{{state.signals_count}}`: Number of alerts detected

NOTE: The `{{context.rule.severity}}` and `{{context.rule.risk_score}}`
placeholders contain the rule's default values even when the *Severity override*
and *Risk score override* options are used.

[[placeholder-examples]]
===== Alert placeholder examples

To understand which fields to parse, see the <<rule-api-overview>> to view the JSON representation of rules.

Example using `{{context.rule.filters}}` to output a list of filters:

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------
{{#context.rule.filters}}
{{^meta.disabled}}{{meta.key}} {{#meta.negate}}NOT {{/meta.negate}}{{meta.type}} {{^exists}}{{meta.value}}{{meta.params.query}}{{/exists}}{{/meta.disabled}}
{{/context.rule.filters}}
--------------------------------------------------

Example using `{{context.alerts}}` as an array, which contains each alert generated since the last time the action was executed:

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------
{{#context.alerts}}
Detection alert for user: {{user.name}}
{{/context.alerts}}
--------------------------------------------------

Example using the mustache "current element" notation `{{.}}` to output all the rule references in the `signal.rule.references` array:

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------
{{#signal.rule.references}} {{.}} {{/signal.rule.references}}
--------------------------------------------------

[[rule-response-action]]
=== Set up response actions (optional)
Use Response Actions to set up additional functionality that will run whenever a rule executes.

preview::[]

The Osquery Response Action allows you to include live Osquery queries with a custom query rule. When an alert is generated, Osquery automatically collects data on the system related to the alert. Refer to <<osquery-response-action>> to learn more.

[[indicator-value-lists]]
=== Use value lists with indicator match rules

While there are numerous ways you can add data into indicator indices, you can use value lists as the indicator match index in an indicator match rule. Take the following scenario, for example:

You uploaded a value list of known ransomware domains, and you want to be notified if any of those domains matches a value contained in a domain field in your security event index pattern.

. Upload a value list of indicators.
. Create an indicator match rule and fill in the following fields:
.. *Index patterns*: The Elastic Security event indices on which the rule runs.
.. *Custom query*: The query and filters used to retrieve the required results from the Elastic Security event indices (e.g., `host.domain :*`).
.. *Indicator index patterns*: Value lists are stored in a hidden index called `.items-<Kibana space>`. Enter the name of the {kib} space in which this rule will run in this field.
.. *Indicator index query*: Enter the value `list_id :`, followed by the name of the value list you want to use as your indicator index (uploaded in Step 1 above).
.. *Indicator mapping*
* *Field*: Enter the field from the Elastic Security event indices to be used for comparing values.
* *Indicator index field*: Enter the type of value list you created (i.e., `keyword`, `text`, or `IP`).
+
TIP: If you don't remember this information, go to *Manage* -> *Rules* -> *Import value lists*. Locate the appropriate value list and note the field in the corresponding `Type` column. (Examples include keyword, text, and IP.)
