== Creating detection rules

beta[]

Rules run periodically and search for source events or {ml} job anomaly scores
that meet their criteria. When a rule's criteria are met, a detections alert is
created.

You can create these types of rules:

* *Custom query*: Query-based rule, which searches the defined indices and
creates an alert when a document matches the rule's query.
* *Machine learning*: {ml-cap} rule, which creates an alert when a {ml} job
discovers an anomaly above the defined threshold (see <<machine-learning>>).
+
For {ml} rules, the associated {ml} job must be running. If the {ml} job is not
running, the rule will:

** Run and create alerts if existing anomaly scores above the defined threshold
are discovered.
** Issue an error stating the {ml} job was not running when the rule executed.
* *Threshold rules*: Searches the defined indices and creates a detections alert
when the number of times the specified field's value meets the threshold during
a single execution. When multiple values meet the threshold, an alert is
generated for each value.
+
For example, if the threshold `field` is `source.ip` and its `value` is `10`, an
alert is generated for every source IP address that appears in at least 10 of
the rule's search results.
* *EQL*: Searches the defined indices and creates an alert when results match an
{ref}/eql.html[Event Query Language (EQL)] query.
* *Threat match*: Creates an alert when {es-sec} index field values match
field values defined in the specified threat indices. For example, you
can create a threat index for IP addresses and use this index to create an alert
whenever an event's `destination.ip` equals a value in the index. Threat index
field mappings should be {ecs-ref}[ECS-compliant]. For information on creating
{es} indices and field types, see
{ref}/getting-started-index.html[Index some documents],
{ref}/indices-create-index.html[Create index API] and
{ref}/mapping-types.html[Field data types].

When creating or modifying rules, you can add exceptions that prevent a rule
from generating an alert even when its criteria are met. This is useful for
reducing noise, such as preventing alerts from trusted processes and internal
IP addresses. <<detections-ui-exceptions>> describes how to add exceptions to a
rule.

NOTE: You can add exceptions to custom query, EQL, and threat-matching rule
types.

For both prebuilt and custom rules, you can use the
{kib} {kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html[Alerting and Actions] feature
to send notifications when alerts are created. Notifications can be sent via
Email, PagerDuty, Slack, and Webhook, and can be configured when you create or
edit a rule.

Creating a new rule is made up of a number of steps:

. <<create-rule-ui>>
. <<rule-ui-basic-params>>
. <<rule-ui-advanced-params>>
. <<rule-schedule>>
. <<rule-notifications>>

[IMPORTANT]
==============
After you activate a rule, periodically check the rule is running as expected
in the <<alerts-ui-monitor, Monitoring tab>> on the All rules page. If you see
values in the `Gap` column, you can <<troubleshoot-signals>>.

When a rule fails to run, the {es-sec-app} tries to rerun it at its next
scheduled run time.

[[create-rule-ui]]
=== Select rule type and scope

. Go to *Security* -> *Detections* -> *Manage detection rules*.
. Click *Create new rule*.
+
The *Create new rule* page is displayed.
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/create-new-rule.png[]
. Do *one* of the following:
* To create a rule based on a {ml} anomaly threshold, select _Machine Learning_
and then:
.. The required {ml} job.
.. The anomaly score threshold above which alerts are created.
+
[IMPORTANT]
==============
To create or edit {ml} rules, you must have the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license] or use a
{ess-trial}[cloud deployment]. Additionally, you must have the
{ref}/built-in-roles.html[`machine_learning_admin`] user role, and the selected
{ml} job must be running for the rule to function correctly.
==============

* To create a rule based on a KQL or Lucene query, select _Custom query_ and
then:
.. Define which {es} indices the rule searches for alerts.
.. Use the filter and query fields to create the criteria used for detecting
alerts.
+
NOTE: You can use {kib} saved queries (save icon) and queries from saved timelines (`Import query from saved timeline`) as rule conditions.
+
For example, the following rule detects when the `vssadmin delete shadows`
Windows command is executed:

** _Index patterns_: `winlogbeat-*`
+
Winlogbeat ships Windows event logs to {es-sec}.
** _Custom query_: `event.action:"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)" and process.name:"vssadmin.exe" and process.args:("delete" and "shadows")`
+
Searches the `winlogbeat-*` indices for `vssadmin.exe` executions with
the `delete` and `shadow` arguments, which are used to delete a volume's shadow
copies.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/rule-query-example.png[]
+
TIP: This example is based on the
<<volume-shadow-copy-deletion-via-vssadmin, Volume Shadow Copy Deletion via VssAdmin>> prebuilt rule.

* To create a rule based on a source event field threshold, select _Threshold_
and then:
.. Define which {es} indices the rule analyzes for alerts.
.. Use the filter and query fields to create the criteria used for detecting
alerts.
.. Use the _Field_ and _Threshold_ fields to determine which source event field
is used as a threshold and the threshold's value.
+
For example, if the _Field_ is `source.ip` and its _Threshold_ is `10`, an
alert is generated for every source IP address that appears in at least 10 of
the rule's search results.
+
You can also leave the _Field_ undefined. The rule then creates an alert when
the number of search results is equal to or greater than the _Threshold_ value.
+
If you want an alert for 10 or more failed login attempts to a specific host
per rule execution:

** _Custom query_: `host.name : liv-win-19 and event.category : "authentication" and event.outcome : "failure"`
** _Field_: Leave blank
** _Threshold_: `10`

* To create a new EQL rule, select _Event Correlation_ and then:
.. Define which {es} indices the rule searches for alerts.
.. Add an {ref}/eql-syntax.html[EQL statement] used to detect alerts.
+
For example the following rule detects when `msxsl.exe` makes an outbound
network connection:

** _Index patterns_: `winlogbeat-*`
+
Winlogbeat ship Windows events to {es-sec}.
** _EQL query_: `sequence by process.entity_id [process where event.type in ("start", "process_started") and process.name == "msxsl.exe"] [network where event.type == "connection" and process.name == "msxsl.exe" and network.direction == "outgoing"]`
+
Searches the `winlogbeat-*` indices for sequences of a `msxsl.exe` process start
event followed by an outbound network connection event that was started by the
`msxsl.exe` process.
+

* To create a threat-match rule that searches the specified threat indices for
field values, select _Threat Match_ and then fill in these fields:
.. _Index patterns_: The {es-sec} event indices on which the rules runs.
.. _Custom query_: The query and filters used to retrieve the required results from
the {es-sec} event indices. For example, if you only need to check
`destination.ip` event values, add `destination.ip : *`.
+
TIP: If you want the rule to check every field in the indices, use this
wildcard expression: `*:*`.
.. _Threat index patterns_: The threat indices containing field values for which
you want to generate alerts.
.. _Threat index query_: The query and filters used to filter the fields from
the threat indices.
.. _Threat Mapping_: Compares the values of the specified event and threat field
values. When the field values are identical, an alert is generated. To define
which field values are compared from the indices:
** _Field_: The field used for comparing values in the {es-sec} event
indices.
** _Threat index field_: The field used for comparing values in the threat
indices.
.. You can add `AND` and `OR` clauses to define when alerts are generated.
+
For example, to create a rule that generates alerts when `host.name` *and*
`destination.ip` field values in the `logs-*` or `packetbeat-*` {es-sec} indices
are identical to the corresponding field values in the `ip-threat-list` threat
index:
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/threat-math-rule-query-example.png[]

. Select the Timeline template used when you investigate an alert created by
the rule in Timeline (optional).
+
TIP: Before you create rules, create <<timelines-ui, Timeline templates>> so
they can be selected here. When alerts generated by the rule are investigated
in Timeline, Timeline query values are replaced with their corresponding alert
field values.

. Click *Continue*.
+
The *About rule* pane is displayed.

. Continue with <<rule-ui-basic-params>>.

[float]
[[rule-ui-basic-params]]
=== Configure basic rule settings

. Fill in the following fields:
.. _Name_: The rule's name.
.. _Description_: A description of what the rule does.
.. _Default severity_: Select the severity level of alerts created by the rule:
* `Low`: Alerts that are of interest but generally not considered to be
security incidents. Sometimes, a combination of low severity events can
indicate suspicious activity.
* `Medium`: Alerts that require investigation.
* `High`: Alerts that require an immediate investigation.
* `Critical`: Alerts that indicate it is highly likely a security incident has
occurred.
.. _Severity override_ (optional): Select to use source event values to
override the _Default severity_ in generated alerts. When selected, a UI
component is displayed where you can map the source event field values to
severity levels. For example, if you want to map severity levels to `host.name`
values:
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/severity-mapping-ui.png[]
.. _Default risk score_: A numerical value between 0 and 100 that correlates
with the _Severity_ level. General guidelines are:
* `0` - `21` represents low severity.
* `22` - `47` represents medium severity.
* `48` - `73` represents high severity.
* `74` - `100` represents critical severity.
.. _Risk score override_ (optional): Select to use a source event value to
override the _Default risk score_ in generated alerts. When selected, a UI
component is displayed where you can select the source field used for the risk
score. For example, if you want to use the source event's risk score in
alerts:
+

. Continue with *one* of the following:

* <<rule-ui-advanced-params>>
* <<rule-schedule>>

[float]
[[rule-ui-advanced-params]]
=== Configure advanced rule settings (optional)


. Click *Advanced settings* and fill in these fields:
.. _Reference URLs_ (optional): References to information that is relevant to
the rule. For example, links to background information.
.. _False positives_ (optional): List of common scenarios that may produce
false-positive alerts.
.. _MITRE ATT&CK^TM^_ (optional): Relevant MITRE framework tactics and techniques.
.. _Tags_ (optional): Words and phrases used to categorize, filter, and search
the rule.
.. _Investigation guide_ (optional): Information for analysts investigating
alerts created by the rule.
.. _Author_ (optional): The rule's authors.
.. _License_ (optional): The rule's license.
.. _Elastic endpoint exceptions_ (optional): Adds all Elastic Endpoint Security
rule exceptions to this rule (see <<detections-ui-exceptions>>).
+
NOTE: If you select this option, you can add
<<endpoint-rule-exceptions, Endpoint exceptions>> on the Rule details page.
Additionally, all future exceptions added to the Elastic Endpoint Security rule
also affect this rule.

.. _Building block_ (optional): Select to create a building-block rule. By
default, alerts generated from a building-block rule are not displayed in the
UI. See <<building-block-rule>> for more information.
.. _Rule name override_ (optional): Select a source event field to use as the
rule name in the UI (Alerts table). This is useful for exposing, at a glance,
more information about an alert. For example, if the rule generates alerts from
Suricata, selecting `event.action` lets you see what action (Suricata category)
caused the event directly in the Alerts table.
.. _Timestamp override_ (optional): Select a source event timestamp field. When selected, the rule's query uses the selected field, instead of the default `@timestamp` field, to search for alerts. This can help reduce missing alerts due to network or server outages. Specifically, if your ingest pipeline adds a timestamp when events are sent to {es}, this avoids missing alerts due to ingestion delays.
+
TIP: These Filebeat modules have an `event.ingested` timestamp field that can
be used instead of the default `@timestamp` field:
{filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-microsoft.html[Microsoft] and
{filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-gsuite.html[GSuite].

. Click *Continue*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/schedule-rule.png[]
The *Schedule rule* pane is displayed.

. Continue with <<rule-schedule>>.

[float]
[[rule-schedule]]
=== Set the rule's schedule

. Select how often the rule runs.
. Optionally, add `Additional look-back time` to the rule. When defined, the
rule searches indices with the additional time.
+
For example, if you set a rule to run every 5 minutes with an additional
look-back time of 1 minute, the rule runs every 5 minutes but analyses the
documents added to indices during the last 6 minutes.
+
[IMPORTANT]
==============
It is recommended to set the `Additional look-back time` to at
least 1 minute. This ensures there are no missing alerts when a rule does not
run exactly at its scheduled time.

The {es-sec-app} performs deduplication. Duplicate alerts discovered during the
`Additional look-back time` are *not* created.
==============
. Click *Continue*.
+
[[rule-actions]]
The *Rule actions* pane is displayed.
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/rule-actions.png[]

. Do *one* of the following:

* Continue with <<rule-notifications>>.
* Create the rule (with or without activation).

[float]
[[rule-notifications]]
=== Set up alert notifications (optional)

Use {kib} Actions to set up notifications sent via other systems when alerts
are generated.

NOTE: To use {kib} Actions for alert notifications, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license].

. Set when to send notifications:

* _On each rule execution_: Sends a notification every time new alerts are
generated.
* _Hourly_: Sends a notification every hour.
* _Daily_: Sends a notification every day.
* _Weekly_: Sends a notification every week.
+
NOTE: Notifications are sent only when new alerts are generated.
+
The available action types are displayed.
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/available-action-types.png[]

. Select the required action type, which determines how notifications are sent (Email, PagerDuty, Slack, Webhook).
+
NOTE: Each action type requires a connector. Connectors store the
information required to send the notification from the external system. You can
configure connectors while creating the rule or on the {kib} Alerts and Actions
page (*Management* -> *Alerts and Actions* -> *Connectors*). For more
information, see {kibana-ref}/action-types.html[Action and connector types].
+
The selected action type fields are displayed (Slack example).
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/selected-action-type.png[]

.. Fill in the fields for the selected action types. For all action types, click
the icon above the `Message` field to add
<<rule-action-variables, placeholders>> for rule and alert details to the
notifications.

. Create the rule with or without activation.
+
NOTE: When you activate a rule, it is queued and its schedule is determined by
its initial run time. For example, if you activate a rule that runs every 5
minutes at 14:03 but it does not run until 14:04, it will run again at 14:09.
