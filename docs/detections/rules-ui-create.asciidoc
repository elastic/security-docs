== Creating detection rules

beta[]

Rules run periodically and search for source events or {ml} job anomaly scores
that meet their criteria. When a rule's criteria are met, a detections alert is
created.

You can create these types of rules:

* *Custom query*: Query-based rule, which searches the defined indices and
creates an alert when a document matches the rule's query.
* *Machine learning*: {ml-cap} rule, which creates an alert when a {ml} job
discovers an anomaly above the defined threshold (see <<machine-learning>>).
+
For {ml} rules, the associated {ml} job must be running. If the {ml} job is not
running, the rule will:

** Run and create alerts if existing anomaly scores above the defined threshold
are discovered.
** Issue an error stating the {ml} job was not running when the rule executed.
* *Threshold rules*: Searches the defined indices and creates a detections alert
when the number of times the specified field's value meets the threshold during
a single execution. When multiple values meet the threshold, an alert is
generated for each value.
+
For example, if the threshold `field` is `source.ip` and its `value` is `10`, an
alert is generated for every source IP address that appears in at least 10 of
the rule's search results.

When creating or modifying rules, you can add exceptions that prevent a rule
from generating an alert even when its criteria are met. This is useful for
reducing noise, such as preventing alerts from trusted processes and internal
IP addresses. <<detections-ui-exceptions>> describes how to add exceptions to a
rule.

For both prebuilt and custom rules, you can use the
{kib} {kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html[Alerting and Actions] feature
to send notifications when alerts are created. Notifications can be sent via
Email, PagerDuty, Slack, and Webhook, and can be configured when you create or
edit a rule.

Creating a new rule is made up of a number of steps:

. <<create-rule-ui>>
. <<rule-ui-basic-params>>
. <<rule-ui-advanced-params>>
. <<rule-schedule>>
. <<rule-notifications>>

[IMPORTANT]
==============
After you activate a rule, periodically check the rule is running as expected
in the <<alerts-ui-monitor, Monitoring tab>> on the All rules page. If you see
values in the `Gap` column, you can <<troubleshoot-signals>>.

When a rule fails to run, the {es-sec-app} tries to rerun it at its next
scheduled run time.

=== Select rule type and scope

. Go to *Security* -> *Detections* -> *Manage detection rules*.
. Click *Create new rule*.
+
The *Create new rule* page is displayed.
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/create-new-rule.png[]
. Do *one* of the following:
* To create a rule based on a {ml} anomaly threshold, select _Machine Learning_
and then:
.. The required {ml} job.
.. The anomaly score threshold above which alerts are created.
+
[IMPORTANT]
==============
To create or edit {ml} rules, you must have the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license] or use a
{ess-trial}[cloud deployment]. Additionally, you must have the
{ref}/built-in-roles.html[`machine_learning_admin`] user role, and the selected
{ml} job must be running for the rule to function correctly.
==============

* To create a rule based on a KQL or Lucene query, select _Custom query_ and
then:
.. Define which {es} indices the rule searches for alerts.
.. Use the filter and query fields to create the criteria used for detecting
alerts.
+
NOTE: You can use {kib} saved queries (save icon) and queries from saved timelines (`Import query from saved timeline`) as rule conditions.
+
For example, the following rule detects when the `vssadmin delete shadows`
Windows command is executed:

** _Index patterns_: `winlogbeat-*`
+
Winlogbeat ships Windows event logs to the SIEM app.
** _Custom query_: `event.action:"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)" and process.name:"vssadmin.exe" and process.args:("delete" and "shadows")`
+
Searches the `winlogbeat-*` indices for `vssadmin.exe` executions with
the `delete` and `shadow` arguments, which are used to delete a volume's shadow
copies.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/rule-query-example.png[]
+
TIP: This example is based on the
<<volume-shadow-copy-deletion-via-vssadmin, Volume Shadow Copy Deletion via VssAdmin>> prebuilt rule.

* To create a rule based on a source event field threshold, select _Threshold_
and then:
.. Define which {es} indices the rule analyzes for alerts.
.. Use the filter and query fields to create the criteria used for detecting
alerts.
.. Use the _Field_ and _Threshold_ fields to determine which source event field
is used as a threshold and the threshold's value.
+
For example, if the _Field_ is `source.ip` and its _Threshold_ is `10`, an
alert is generated for every source IP address that appears in at least 10 of
the rule's search results.
+
You can also leave the _Field_ undefined. The rule then creates an alert when
the number of search results is equal to or greater than the _Threshold_ value.
+
If you want an alert for 10 or more failed login attempts to a specific host
per rule execution:

** _Custom query_: `host.name : liv-win-19 and event.category : "authentication" and event.outcome : "failure"`
** _Field_: Leave blank
** _Threshold_: `10`

. Select the Timeline template used when you investigate an alert created by
the rule in Timeline (optional).
+
TIP: Before you create rules, create <<timelines-ui, Timeline templates>> so
they can be selected here. When alerts generated by the rule are investigated
in Timeline, Timeline query values are replaced with their corresponding alert
field values.

. Click *Continue*.

. Continue with <<rule-ui-basic-params>>.

[float]
[[rule-ui-basic-params]]
=== Configure basic rule settings

. Fill in the following fields:
.. _Name_: The rule's name.
.. _Description_: A description of what the rule does.
.. _Default severity_: Select the severity level of alerts created by the rule:
* `Low`: Alerts that are of interest but generally not considered to be
security incidents. Sometimes, a combination of low severity events can
indicate suspicious activity.
* `Medium`: Alerts that require investigation.
* `High`: Alerts that require an immediate investigation.
* `Critical`: Alerts that indicate it is highly likely a security incident has
occurred.
.. _Severity override_ (optional): Select to use source event values to
override the _Default severity_ in generated alerts. When selected, a UI
component is displayed where you can map the source event field values to
severity levels. For example, if you want to map severity levels to `host.name`
values:
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/severity-mapping-ui.png[]
.. _Default risk score_: A numerical value between 0 and 100 that correlates
with the _Severity_ level. General guidelines are:
* `0` - `21` represents low severity.
* `22` - `47` represents medium severity.
* `48` - `73` represents high severity.
* `74` - `100` represents critical severity.
.. _Risk score override_ (optional): Select to use a source event value to
override the _Default risk score_ in generated alerts. When selected, a UI
component is displayed where you can select the source field used for the risk
score. For example, if you want to use the source event's risk score in
alerts:

. Continue with *one* of the following:

* <<rule-ui-advanced-params>>
* <<rule-schedule>>

[float]
[[rule-ui-advanced-params]]
=== Configure advanced rule settings (optional)


. Click *Advanced settings* and fill in these fields:
.. _Reference URLs_ (optional): References to information that is relevant to
the rule. For example, links to background information.
.. _False positives_ (optional): List of common scenarios that may produce
false-positive alerts.
.. _MITRE ATT&CK^TM^_ (optional): Relevant MITRE framework tactics and techniques.
.. _Tags_ (optional): Words and phrases used to categorize, filter, and search
the rule.
.. _Investigation guide_ (optional): Information for analysts investigating
alerts created by the rule.
.. _Author_ (optional): The rule's authors.
.. _License_ (optional): The rule's license.
.. _Elastic endpoint exceptions_ (optional): Adds all Elastic Endpoint Security
rule exceptions to this rule (see <<detections-ui-exceptions>>).
+
NOTE: If you select this option, you can add
<<endpoint-rule-exceptions, Endpoint exceptions>> on the Rule details page.
Additionally, all future exceptions added to the Elastic Endpoint Security rule
also affect this rule.

.. _Building block_ (optional): Select to create a building-block rule. By
default, alerts generated from a building-block rule are not displayed in the
UI. See <<building-block-rule>> for more information.
.. _Rule name override_ (optional): Select a source event field to use as the
rule name in the UI (Alerts table). This is useful for exposing, at a glance,
more information about an alert. For example, if the rule generates alerts from
Suricata, selecting `event.action` lets you see what action (Suricata category)
caused the event directly in the Alerts table.
.. _Timestamp override_ (optional): Select a source event timestamp field. When selected, the rule's query uses the selected field, instead of the default `@timestamp` field, to search for alerts. This can help reduce missing alerts due to network or server outages. Specifically, if your ingest pipeline adds a timestamp when events are sent to {es}, this avoids missing alerts due to ingestion delays.
+
TIP: These Filebeat modules have an `event.ingested` timestamp field that can
be used instead of the default `@timestamp` field:
{filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-microsoft.html[Microsoft] and
{filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-gsuite.html[GSuite].

. Click *Continue*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/schedule-rule.png[]
The *Schedule rule* pane is displayed.

. Continue with <<rule-schedule>>.

[float]
[[rule-schedule]]
=== Set the rule's schedule

. Select how often the rule runs.
. Optionally, add `Additional look-back time` to the rule. When defined, the
rule searches indices with the additional time.
+
For example, if you set a rule to run every 5 minutes with an additional
look-back time of 1 minute, the rule runs every 5 minutes but analyses the
documents added to indices during the last 6 minutes.
+
[IMPORTANT]
==============
It is recommended to set the `Additional look-back time` to at
least 1 minute. This ensures there are no missing alerts when a rule does not
run exactly at its scheduled time.

The {siem-app} performs deduplication. Duplicate alerts discovered during the
`Additional look-back time` are *not* created.
==============
. Click *Continue*.
+
[[rule-actions]]
The *Rule actions* pane is displayed.
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/rule-actions.png[]

. Do *one* of the following:

* Continue with <<rule-notifications>>.
* Create the rule (with or without activation).

[float]
[[rule-notifications]]
=== Set up alert notifications (optional)

Use {kib} Actions to set up notifications sent via other systems when alerts
are generated.

NOTE: To use {kib} Actions for alert notifications, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license].

. Set when to send notifications:

* _On each rule execution_: Sends a notification every time new alerts are
generated.
* _Hourly_: Sends a notification every hour.
* _Daily_: Sends a notification every day.
* _Weekly_: Sends a notification every week.
+
NOTE: Notifications are sent only when new alerts are generated.
+
The available action types are displayed.
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/available-action-types.png[]

. Select the required action type, which determines how notifications are sent (Email, PagerDuty, Slack, Webhook).
+
NOTE: Each action type requires a connector. Connectors store the
information required to send the notification from the external system. You can
configure connectors while creating the rule or on the {kib} Alerts and Actions
page (*Management* -> *Alerts and Actions* -> *Connectors*). For more
information, see {kibana-ref}/action-types.html[Action and connector types].
+
The selected action type fields are displayed (Slack example).
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/selected-action-type.png[]

.. Fill in the fields for the selected action types. For all action types, click
the icon above the `Message` field to add
<<rule-action-variables, placeholders>> for rule and alert details to the
notifications.

. Create the rule with or without activation.
+
NOTE: When you activate a rule, it is queued and its schedule is determined by
its initial run time. For example, if you activate a rule that runs every 5
minutes at 14:03 but it does not run until 14:04, it will run again at 14:09.
