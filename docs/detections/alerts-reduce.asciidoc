== Reduce notifications and alerts

{elastic-sec} offers several features to help reduce the number of notifications and alerts generated by your detection rules. This table provides a general comparison of these features, with links for more details:

[cols="2"]
|===

| <<snooze-rule-actions,Rule action snoozing>>
a| *_Stops a specific rule's notification actions from running_*. 

Use to avoid unnecessary notifications from a specific rule. The rule continues to run and generate alerts during the snooze period, but its <<rule-notifications,notification actions>> don't run.

| {kibana-ref}/maintenance-windows.html[Maintenance window]
a| *_Prevents all rules' notification actions from running_*. 

Use to avoid false alarms and unnecessary notifications during planned outages. All rules continue to run and generate alerts during the maintenance window, but their <<rule-notifications,notification actions>> don't run.

NOTE: Maintenance windows are a {kib} feature, configured outside of the {security-app} in *Stack Management*.

| <<alert-suppression,Alert suppression>>
a| *_Reduces repeated or duplicate alerts created by a custom query rule_*. 

Use to reduce the number of alerts created by a <<create-custom-rule,custom query rule>> that matches multiple source events. Matching events are grouped by their values in a specified field, and only one alert is created for each group.

| <<detections-ui-exceptions,Rule exception>>
a| *_Prevents a rule from creating alerts under specific conditions_*.

Use to reduce false positive alerts by preventing trusted processes and network activity from generating unnecessary alerts. You can configure an exception to be used by a single rule or shared among multiple rules, but they typically don't affect _all_ rules.
