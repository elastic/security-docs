=== Run Osquery
Osquery allows you to run live queries against an alert's host to learn more about your infrastructure and operating systems. For example, with Osquery, you can search your system for indicators of compromise that might have contributed to the alert. You can then use this data to inform your investigation and alert triage efforts.

[IMPORTANT]
============

You must complete the following to access Osquery and run searches against your hosts:

* Enable the {kibana-ref}/manage-osquery-integration.html[Osquery manager integration] on the host associated with the alert.
* Update your {kibana-ref}/osquery.html[role's privileges] to allow access to Osquery.
* Verify that the {fleet-guide}/view-elastic-agent-status.html[{agent}'s status] is *Healthy*. Refer to {fleet-guide}/fleet-troubleshooting.html[{fleet} Troubleshooting] if it is not.
============


. Click the *View details* button from the Alerts table to open the Alert details flyout.
. Click *Take action*, then select *Run Osquery*.
. Select one or more {agent}s or groups to query. Start typing in the search field to get suggestions for {agent}s by name, ID, platform, and policy.

+
NOTE: The host associated with the alert is automatically selected. You can specify additional hosts to query.

. Enter a new query or select a saved query.
