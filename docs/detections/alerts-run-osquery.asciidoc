=== Run Osquery
Osquery allows you to run live queries against an alert's host to learn more about your infrastructure and operating systems. For example, with Osquery, you can search your system for indicators of compromise that might have contributed to the alert. You can then use this data to inform your investigation and alert triage efforts.

IMPORTANT: The host associated with the alert must have the Osquery manager integration enabled and the {fleet-guide}/view-elastic-agent-status.html[{agent}'s status] must be *Healthy* (refer to {fleet-guide}/fleet-troubleshooting.html[{fleet} Troubleshooting] if the {agent} status isn't). In addition, to use Osqeury, your role requires {kibana-ref}/osquery.html[specific privileges]. 

. Click the *View details* button from the Alerts table to open the Alert details flyout.
. Click *Take action*, then select *Run Osquery*.
. Select one or more {agent}s or groups to query. Start typing in the search field to get suggestions for {agent}s by name, ID, platform, and policy.

+
NOTE: The host associated with the alert is automatically selected. You can specify additional hosts to query.
+

. Enter a new query or select a saved query.

. (Optional) Expand the **Advanced** section to view or set {kibana-ref}/advanced-osquery.html[mapped ECS fields] included in the results from the live query.

TIP: To save the query for future use, click *Save for later* and define the ID,
description, and other {kibana-ref}/osquery.html#osquery-manage-query[details].

. Review the results in the table. You can also navigate to *Discover* to dive deeper into the response,
or use the drag-and-drop *Lens* editor to create visualizations.
. To view more information about the request, such as failures, open the *Status* tab in the results table.
