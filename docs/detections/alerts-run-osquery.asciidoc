[[alerts-run-osquery]]
=== Run Osquery from a detection alert
{kibana-ref}/osquery.html[Osquery] allows you to run live queries against an alert's host to learn more about your infrastructure and operating systems. For example, with Osquery, you can search your system for indicators of compromise that might have contributed to the alert. You can then use this data to form your investigation and alert triage efforts.
