=== Run Osquery from a detection alert
{kibana-ref}/osquery.html[Osquery] allows you to run live queries against an alert's host to learn more about your infrastructure and operating systems. For example, with Osquery, you can search your system for indicators of compromise that might have contributed to the alert. You can then use this data to form your investigation and alert triage efforts.

[IMPORTANT]
============

You must complete the following to access Osquery and run searches against your hosts:

* Enable the {kibana-ref}/manage-osquery-integration.html[Osquery manager integration] on the host associated with the alert.
* Update your {kibana-ref}/osquery.html[role's privileges] to allow access to Osquery.
* Verify that {fleet-guide}/view-elastic-agent-status.html[{agent}'s status] is *Healthy*. Refer to {fleet-guide}/fleet-troubleshooting.html[{fleet} Troubleshooting] if it is not.
============


. Do one of the following from the Alerts table:
** Click the *View details* button to open the Alert details flyout, then click *Take action -> Run Osquery*.
** Select the *More actions* menu (*...*), then select *Run Osquery*.
. Select one or more {agent}s or groups to query. Start typing in the search field to get suggestions for {agent}s by name, ID, platform, and policy.

+
NOTE: The host associated with the alert is automatically selected. You can specify additional hosts to query.
+

. Enter a new query or select a saved query.

. (Optional) Expand the **Advanced** section to view or set {kibana-ref}/osquery.html#osquery-map-fields[mapped ECS fields] included in the results from the live query.
. Click **Submit**.

+
TIP: To save the query for future use, click *Save for later* and define the ID,
description, and other {kibana-ref}/osquery.html#osquery-manage-query[details].

. Review the results in the table. You can also:
** Navigate to *Discover* to dive deeper into the response.
** Use the drag-and-drop *Lens* editor to create visualizations.
** Click the *Timeline* button (image:images/timeline-button-osquery.png[Click markdown icon,20,20]) to investigate a single query result in Timeline or *Add to timeline investigation* to investigate all results.

+
TIP: An `action_ID` is generated when you run an Osquery query. The `action_ID` field and value pair is passed to the Timeline's KQL filter when you select the option to open all results in Timeline.
+

. To view more information about the request, such as failures, open the *Status* tab in the results table.
