= Anomaly Detection with Machine Learning

{kibana-ref}/xpack-ml.html[{ml-cap}] functionality is available when
you have the *https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license]*, are
using a *{ess-trial}[cloud deployment]*, or are testing out a *Free Trial*.

You can view the details of detected anomalies within the `Anomalies` table
widget shown on the Hosts, Network and associated Details pages, or even narrow
to the specific date range of an anomaly from the `Max Anomaly Score` details
in the overview of the Host and IP Details pages. Each of these interfaces also
offer the ability to drag and drop details of the anomaly to Timeline, such as
the `Entity` itself, or any of the associated `Influencers`.

[[manage-jobs]]
== Manage machine learning jobs
For users with the `machine_learning_admin` role, the `ML job settings`
interface on the *Detections* page can be used for for viewing, starting, and
stopping {es-sec} machine learning jobs.

TIP: To add a custom job to the `ML job settings` interface, add `Security` to
the job's `Groups` field ({kib} -> {ml-cap} -> Create/Edit job -> Job
details).

[[included-jobs]]
=== Prebuilt jobs

{es-sec} comes with prebuilt {ml} {anomaly-jobs} for automatically detecting
host and network anomalies. The jobs are displayed in the `Anomaly Detection`
interface. They are available when either:

* You ship data using https://www.elastic.co/products/beats[Beats] or the 
<<install-endpoint,{agent}>> and {kib} is configured with the required index 
patterns (such as `auditbeat-*`, `filebeat-*`, `packetbeat-*`, or `winlogbeat-*` 
in {kib} -> {stack-manage-app} -> Index Patterns).

Or

* Your shipped data is ECS-compliant, and {kib} is configured with the shipped
data's index patterns.

<<prebuilt-ml-jobs>> describes all available {ml} jobs, and lists which ECS 
fields are required on your hosts when you are not using {beats} or the {agent}
to ship your data. For information on tuning anomaly results to reduce the
number of false positives, see <<tuning-anomaly-results>>.

NOTE: Machine learning jobs look back and analyse two weeks of historical data
prior to the time they are enabled. After jobs are enabled, they continuously
analyse incoming data. When jobs are stopped and restarted within the two week
time frame, previously analysed data is not processed again.

[[view-anomalies]]
== View detected anomalies
To view the `Anomalies` table widget and `Max Anomaly Score By Job` details,
the user must have the `machine_learning_admin` or `machine_learning_user` role.

NOTE: To adjust the `score` threshold that determines which
{ml-docs}/xpack-ml.html[anomalies] are shown, you can modify {kib} ->
{stack-manage-app} -> Advanced Settings ->
`securitySolution:defaultAnomalyScore`.

[[prebuilt-ml-jobs]]
== Prebuilt job reference

Prebuilt jobs automatically detect file system and network anomalies on your
hosts. To enable jobs when you are not using {beats} or the {agent}, you must
map your data to the ECS fields listed in each job description. Some jobs use 
fields that are not ECS-compliant. These jobs are available only when you use 
{beats} or the {agent} to ship data.

IMPORTANT: If the {agent} or Beat is version 7.10 or higher, use the
<<security-linux-jobs>> and <<security-windows-jobs>> jobs. For earlier 
versions, use the <<security-auditbeat-jobs>> and <<security-winlogbeat-jobs>>
jobs. After you upgrade to 7.10 or later versions and start using the new jobs,
disable the old jobs.
