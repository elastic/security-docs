== Visual event analyzer

Elastic Security allows any event detected by Elastic Endpoint to be analyzed using a process-based visual analyzer. This enables security analysts to drill down into all related hosts, processes, and other events to aid in their investigations.

=== Find events to analyze

You can only visualize events triggered by hosts configured with the Elastic Endpoint Security Integration or any sysmon data from `winlogbeat`.

In KQL, this translates to any event with the `agent.type` set to either:

* `endpoint`
* `winlogbeat` with `event.module` set to `sysmon`

To access events that can be visually analyzed:

1. Select *Explore* -> *Hosts*, then select the *Events* tab. A list of all your hosts' events appears at the bottom of the Hosts page. Similarly, you can go to *Detect* -> *Alerts* and then scroll down to view the Alerts table. 

2. Create a KQL query that filters all `endpoint` detected events by entering either query into the KQL search bar, and then selecting **Update**:
** `agent.type:"endpoint" and process.entity_id : *`
** `agent.type:"winlogbeat" and event.module: "sysmon" and process.entity_id : *`

3. For the event that you want to analyze, click **Analyze event**. The visual analyzer view appears.

NOTE: Events that cannot be analyzed will not have the **Analyze event** option available. This might happen if the event has incompatible field mappings.

TIP: You can also analyze events from <<timelines-ui,Timelines>>.

[[visual-analyzer-ui]]
=== Visual event analyzer UI

Inside the visual analyzer, each cube represents a process (such as an executable file or network event). Click and drag in Timeline view to see all process relationships.

To understand what fields were used to create the process, select the **Process Tree** to view the schema that created the graphical view. The fields included are:

* `SOURCE`: Can be either `endpoint` or `winlogbeat`
* `ID`: Event field that uniquely identifies a node
* `EDGE`: Event field which indicates the relationship between two nodes

View the **Legend** to understand the state of each process node.

To expand the analyzer to a full screen, select the **Full Screen** icon above the left panel.

The left panel contains a list of all processes related to the event, starting with the event chain's first process. **Analyzed Events**, as in the event you selected to analyze from either the events list or your Timeline, are highlighted by a light blue outline around the cube.

In the graphical view, you can:

- Zoom in and out of the graphical view using the slider to the right of the Timeline
- Click and drag around the graphical view to more process relationships
- See the time passed between each process
- See all events related to each process

[[process-and-event-details]]
=== Process and event details

To see more details about each related process, select the process in the left panel or the graphical view. The left panel displays process details such as:

* The number of events associated with the process
* The timestamp of when the process was executed
* The file path of the process within the host
* The `process-pid`
* The user name and domain that ran the process
* Any other relevant process information

When you first select a process, it appears in a loading state. If loading data for a given process fails, click **Reload `{process-name}`** beneath the process to reload the data.

See event details by selecting that event's URL at the top of the process details view or choosing one of the event pills in the graphical view.

Events are categorized based on their `event.category`.

When you select an `event.category`, pill, all the events within that category are listed in the left panel. To view more details about a specific event, select it from the list.

NOTE: As of {stack} version 7.10.0, there is no limit to the number of events that can be associated with a process. However, in {stack} minor versions < = 7.9.0, each process is limited to only 100 events.
