Alert suppression allows you to reduce the number of repeated or duplicate detection alerts created by a <<create-custom-rule,custom query detection rule>> each time the rule runs. 

Normally, when a rule matches multiple source events, multiple alerts are created, one for each event. When alert suppression is configured, matching events are grouped by a specified field, and only one alert is created for each group per rule execution. You can also specify multiple fields to group events by unique combinations of values.

The {security-app} displays several indicators in the Alerts table and the alert details flyout when a detection alert is created with alert suppression enabled. You can view the original events associated with suppressed alerts by investigating the alert in Timeline.

NOTE: Alert suppression is not available for Elastic prebuilt rules. However, if you want to suppress alerts for a prebuilt rule, you can duplicate it, then configure alert suppression on the duplicated rule.

=== Configure alert suppression

You can configure alert suppression when you create or edit a <<create-custom-rule,custom query rule>>. When configuring the rule type (the *Define rule* step for a new rule, the *Definition* tab for an existing rule), enter one or more field names in *Suppress Alerts By*. Configure other rule settings, then save and enable the rule.

TIP: Use the *Rule preview* before saving the rule to visualize how alert suppression will affect the alerts created, based on historical data.

=== Confirm suppressed alerts

The {security-app} displays several indicators of whether a detection alert was created with alert suppression enabled, and how many duplicate alerts were suppressed.

* *Alerts* table — Icon in the *Rule* column. Hover to display the number of suppressed alerts:

=== Investigate events for suppressed alerts

With alert suppression, detection alerts aren't created for the grouped source events, but you can still retrieve the events for further analysis or investigation. Do one of the following to open Timeline with the original events associated with both the created alert and the suppressed alerts:

* *Alerts* table — Select *Investigate in timeline* in the *Actions* column.
