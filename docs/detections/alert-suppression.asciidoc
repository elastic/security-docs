Alert suppression allows you to reduce the number of repeated or duplicate detection alerts created by a custom query type detection rule. 

Normally, when a rule matches multiple source events, multiple alerts are created, one for each event. With alert suppression configured, matching events are grouped by a specified field, and only one alert will be created for each group of events. You can also specify multiple fields to group events by unique combinations of values.

Suppressed alerts are indicated in the Alerts table and the alert details flyout, and you can view the original events for suppressed alerts by investigating the alert in Timeline.

=== Configure alert suppression

You can configure alert suppression when you create or edit a <<create-custom-rule,custom query rule>>. When configuring the rule type (the *Define rule* step for a new rule, the *Definition* tab for an existing rule), enter one or more field names in *Suppress Alerts By*. Configure other rule settings, then save and enable the rule.

TIP: Use the *Rule preview* before saving the rule to visualize how alert suppression will affect the alerts created, based on historical data.

=== Confirm suppressed alerts

The {security-app} provides several indicators if a detection alert was created using alert suppression, and how many duplicate alerts were suppressed.

* *Alerts* table — icon in the *Rule* column. Hover to display the number of suppressed alerts:

=== Investigate events for suppressed alerts

With alert suppression, detection alerts aren't created for the grouped source events, but you can still retrieve the events for further analysis or investigation. Do one of the following to open Timeline with the original events from both the created alert and the suppressed alerts:

* From the *Alerts* table, select *Investigate in timeline* in the *Actions* column.
