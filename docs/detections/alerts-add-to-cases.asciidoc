[NOTE]
===============================
* After you add an alert to a case, you can remove it from the case activity under the alert summary or by using the <<cases-api-overview,Elastic Security Cases API>>.
* Each case can have a maximum of 1,000 alerts.

=== Add alerts to a new case
To add alerts to a new case:

. Do one of the following:
** To add a single alert to a case, select the *More actions* menu (*...*) in the Alerts table or **Take action** in the alert details flyout, then select *Add to a new case*.
** To add multiple alerts, select the alerts, then select *Add to a new case* from the *Bulk actions* menu.
. Give the case a name, assign a severity level, and provide a description. You can use
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax[Markdown] syntax in the case description.
+
NOTE: If you do not assign your case a severity level, it will be assigned *Low* by default.

. Optionally, add a category, assignees and relevant tags. You can add users only if they
meet the necessary <<case-permissions,prerequisites>>.
. Specify whether you want to sync the status of associated alerts. It is enabled by default; however, you can toggle this setting on or off at any time. If it remains enabled, the alert's status updates whenever the case's status is modified.
. Select a connector. If you've previously added one, that connector displays as the default selection. Otherwise, the default setting is `No connector selected`.
. Click *Create case* after you've completed all of the required fields. A confirmation message is displayed with an option to view the new case. Click the link in the notification or go to the Cases page to view the case.
