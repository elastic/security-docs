=== Add Osquery Response Actions to rules

You can add Osquery Response Actions to new or existing custom query rules. Queries run every time the rule executes.

. Choose one of the following:
** *New rule*: When you are on the last step of <<create-custom-rule,custom query rule>> creation, go to the Response Actions section and click the *osquery* icon.
** *Existing rule*: Edit the rule's settings, then go to the *Actions* tab. In the tab, click the *osquery* icon under the Response Actions section.
. Specify whether you want to set up a single live query or a pack:
** *Query*: Select a saved query or enter a new one. After you enter the query, you can expand the **Advanced** section to view or set {kibana-ref}/osquery.html#osquery-map-fields[mapped ECS fields] included in the results from the live query. Mapping ECS fields is optional.
** *Pack*: Select from available query packs. After you select a pack, all of the queries in the pack are displayed.

[[find-osquery-response-action-results]]
=== Find query results

When an alert is generated, Osquery automatically collects data on the system related to the alert. Query results are displayed within the *Osquery Results* tab in the Alert details flyout. The number next to the *Osquery Results* tab represents the number of queries attached to the rule.

NOTE: Refer to <<view-osquery-results>> for more information about query results.
