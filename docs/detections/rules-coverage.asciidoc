The **MITRE ATT&CK® coverage** page shows which https://attack.mitre.org[MITRE ATT&CK®] adversary tactics and techniques are covered by your installed and enabled detection rules.

Mirroring the MITRE ATT&CK® framework, columns represent a major tactics, and cells within each column represent a tactic's related techniques. Cells are colored progressively darker when more rules are enabled for each technique, as indicated in the **Legend** at the top.

NOTE: This page only includes the detection rules you currently have installed. If there are Elastic prebuilt rules you haven't installed yet, they will not be included in determining your MITRE ATT&CK® coverage.

=== Expand and collapse cells

Click **Collapse cells** or **Expand cells** to change how much information the cells display. Cells always include the technique's name and the number of sub-techniques covered by enabled rules. Expand the cells to also display counts of disabled and enabled rules for each technique.

NOTE: The counts inside cells are affected by how you filter the page. For example, if you filter the **Installed rule status** to only include **Enabled rules**, then all disabled rule counts will be 0 because the filter is excluding disabled rules.
