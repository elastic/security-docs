=== Load and activate prebuilt Elastic rules

To load the {es-sec-app}'s <<prebuilt-rules, prebuilt rules>>, go to *Detect -> Rules -> Load Elastic prebuilt rules and Timeline templates*).

You can then activate whichever rules you want. If you delete any prebuilt rules, a button appears that enables you to reload all of the deleted ones.

Apart from the Elastic Endpoint rule, prebuilt rules are not activated by
default. If you want to modify a prebuilt rule, you must first duplicate it, then make your changes to the duplicated rule. All Elastic prebuilt rules are tagged with the word `Elastic`.
