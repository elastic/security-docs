== Manage detection rules

The Rules page allows you to view and manage all prebuilt and custom detection rules.

On the Rules page, you can:

* <<sort-filter-rules>>
* <<rule-status>>
* <<load-prebuilt-rules>>
* <<select-all-prebuilt-rules>>
* <<download-prebuilt-rules>>
* <<rule-prerequisites>>
* <<edit-rules-settings>>
* <<manage-rules-ui>>
* <<import-export-rules-ui>>
* <<troubleshoot-signals>>

[[sort-filter-rules]]
=== Sort and filter the rules list

To sort the rules list, click any column header. To sort in descending order, click the column header again.

To filter the rules list, enter a search term in the search bar and press **Return**:

* Rule name — Enter a word or phrase from a rule's name.
* Index pattern — Enter an index pattern (such as `filebeat-*`) to display all rules that use it. 
* MITRE ATT&CK tactic or technique — Enter a MITRE ATT&CK tactic name (such as `Defense Evasion`) or technique number (such as `TA0005`) to display all associated rules.

NOTE: Searches for index patterns and MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques must match exactly, are case sensitive, and do _not_ support wildcards. For example, to find rules using the `filebeat-*` index pattern, the search term `filebeat-*` is valid, but `filebeat` and `file*` are not because they don't exactly match the index pattern. Likewise, the MITRE ATT&CK tactic `Defense Evasion` is valid, but `Defense`, `defense evasion`, and `Defense*` are not.

[float]
[[rule-status]]
=== Check the current status of rules

The *Last response* column displays the current status of each rule, based on the most recent attempt to run the rule:

* *Succeeded*: The rule completed its defined search. This doesn't necessarily mean it generated an alert, just that it ran without error.
* *Failed*: The rule encountered an error that prevented it from running. For example, a {ml} rule whose corresponding {ml} job wasn't running.
* *Warning*: Nothing prevented the rule from running, but it might have returned unexpected results. For example, a custom query rule tried to search an index pattern that couldn't be found in {es}.

For {ml} rules, an indicator icon (image:images/rules-table-error-icon.png[Error icon from Rules table,15,15]) also appears in this column if a required {ml} job isn't running. Click the icon to list the affected jobs, then click *Visit rule details page to investigate* to open the rule's details page, where you can start the {ml} job.

[[load-prebuilt-rules]]
=== Load and activate Elastic prebuilt rules

To load the {es-sec-app}'s <<prebuilt-rules, prebuilt rules>>, go to *Manage* -> *Rules* -> *Load Elastic prebuilt rules and Timeline templates*.

You can then activate whichever rules you want. If you delete any prebuilt rules, a button appears that enables you to reload all of the deleted ones.

[NOTE]
==============
Apart from the Elastic Endpoint rule, prebuilt rules are not activated by
default. If you want to modify a prebuilt rule, you must first duplicate it, then make your changes to the duplicated rule. All Elastic prebuilt rules are tagged with the word `Elastic`.

To learn how to enable detection rules in Elastic Security, watch the <<enable-detection-rules, tutorial>> at the end of this topic.
==============

[float]
[[select-all-prebuilt-rules]]
=== Select and duplicate all prebuilt rules

. Go to *Manage* -> *Rules*.
. Click *Select all _x_ rules* above the rules table.
. Click *Bulk actions* -> *Duplicate*.
. Select the *Custom rules* tab.

You can then modify the duplicated rules and, if required, delete the prebuilt ones.

[float]
[[download-prebuilt-rules]]
=== Download latest Elastic prebuilt rules

As of {stack} >=7.13.0, you can download the latest version of Elastic prebuilt rules outside of a regular release cycle. This feature ensures you have the latest detection capabilities before upgrading to the latest {stack}.

To download the latest version of prebuilt rules:

. In {kib}, go to *Management* -> *Integrations*.
. Search for "Prebuilt Security Detection Rules."
. Select the integration, then select the *Settings* tab. The integration settings page is displayed.
+

[[rule-prerequisites]]
=== Confirm rule prerequisites

Many Elastic prebuilt rules are designed to work with specific Elastic integrations and data fields. These prerequisites are identified in the *Related integrations* and *Required fields* fields on a rule's details page (*Manage* -> *Rules*, then click a rule's name). *Related integrations* also displays each integration's installation status and includes links for installing and configuring the listed integrations. 

Additionally, the *Setup guide* section provides guidance on setting up the rule's requirements.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/rule-details-prerequisites.png[Rule details page with Related integrations, Required fields, and Setup guide highlighted]

You can also check rules' related integrations in the *Rules* and *Rule Monitoring* tables. Click the *integrations* badge to display the related integrations in a popup.

TIP: You can hide the *integrations* badge in the Rules tables. Go to *{kib}* -> *Stack Management* -> *Advanced Settings*, then turn off `securitySolution:showRelatedIntegrations`.

[float]
[[edit-rules-settings]]
=== Modify existing rules settings

You can edit an existing rule's settings, and can bulk edit settings for multiple rules at once.

[NOTE]
====
For prebuilt Elastic rules, you can't modify most settings. You can only edit <<rule-schedule, rule actions>> and <<add-exceptions, add exceptions>>.

If you try to bulk edit with both prebuilt and custom rules selected, the action will affect only the rules that can be modified.
====

. Go to *Manage* -> *Rules*.
. Do one of the following:
* Edit a single rule: Select the *All actions* menu (*...*) on a rule, then select *Edit rule settings*. The *Edit rule settings* view opens, where you can modify the <<rules-ui-create, rule's settings>>.
* Bulk edit multiple rules: Select the rules you want to edit, then select an action from the *Bulk actions* menu:
** *Index patterns*: Add or delete the index patterns used by all selected rules.
** *Tags*: Add or delete tags on all selected rules.
** *Add rule actions*: Add <<rule-notifications,notification actions>> on all selected rules.
+
NOTE: The action frequency you select applies to all actions (both new and existing) on all selected rules. If you don't want to change the frequency of existing actions, update the rules separately.

** *Update rule schedules*: Update the <<rule-schedule,schedules>> and look-back times on all selected rules.
** *Apply Timeline template*: Apply a specified <<timeline-templates-ui, Timeline template>> to the selected rules. You can also choose *None* to remove Timeline templates from the selected rules.
. On the flyout that opens, update the settings.
. If available, select *Overwrite all selected _x_* to overwrite the settings on the rules. For example, if you're adding tags to multiple rules, selecting *Overwrite all selected rules tags* removes all the rules' original tags and replaces them with the tags you specify.
. Click *Save*.

[float]
[[manage-rules-ui]]
=== Manage rules

You can duplicate, enable, disable, and delete rules:

NOTE: When duplicating a rule that has exceptions, you can choose to duplicate the rule and its exceptions or duplicate the rule only. If you choose to duplicate the rule and its exceptions, copies of the exceptions are created and added to the duplicated rule's <<detections-ui-exceptions,default rule list>>. In addition, if the original rule uses exceptions from a shared exception list, the duplicated rule will reference the same shared exception list.  

. Go to *Manage* -> *Rules*.
. Do one of the following:
* Select the *All actions* menu (*...*) on a rule, then select an action.
* Select all the rules you want to modify, then select an action from the *Bulk actions* menu.
* To enable or disable a single rule, switch on the rule's *Enabled* toggle.

[float]
[[import-export-rules-ui]]
=== Export and import rules

You can export custom detection rules to an `.ndjson` file, which you can then import into another {elastic-sec} environment. 

[NOTE]
====
You cannot export Elastic prebuilt rules, but you can duplicate a prebuilt rule, then export the duplicated rule.

If you try to export with both prebuilt and custom rules selected, only the custom rules are exported.
====

The `.ndjson` file also includes any actions, action and exception lists related to the exported rules. However, other configuration items require additional handling when exporting and importing rules:

- *Data views*: For rules that use a {kib} data view as a data source, the exported file contains the associated `data_view_id`, but does _not_ include any other data view configuration. To export/import between {kib} spaces, first use the {kibana-ref}/managing-saved-objects.html#managing-saved-objects-share-to-space[Saved Objects] UI (*Stack Management* -> *Kibana* -> *Saved Objects*) to share the data view with the destination space.
+
To import into a different {stack} deployment, the destination cluster must include a data view with a matching data view ID (configured in the {kibana-ref}/data-views.html[data view's advanced settings]). Alternatively, after importing, you can manually reconfigure the rule to use an appropriate data view in the destination system.

- *Actions and connectors*: Rule actions and the connectors used by the actions are included in the exported file, but sensitive information about the connector (such as authentication credentials) is _not_ included. During the rule import process, you are prompted to re-add missing connector details.
+
TIP: You can still use {kib}'s {kibana-ref}/managing-saved-objects.html#managing-saved-objects-export-objects[Saved Objects] UI (*Stack Management* -> *Kibana* -> *Saved Objects*) to export and import any necessary connectors before you export and import the detection rules.

- *Value lists*: Any value lists used for rule exceptions are _not_ included in rule exports or imports. Use the <<edit-value-lists, Import value lists>> UI (*Manage* -> *Rules* -> *Import value lists*) to export and import value lists separately.

To export and import detection rules:

. Go to *Manage* -> *Rules*.
. To export rules:
.. In the rules table, select the rules you want to export.
.. Select *Bulk actions* -> *Export*, then save the exported file.
. To import rules:
+
NOTE: To import rules with actions, you need at least `Read` privileges for the `Action and Connectors` feature. To import rules with actions and overwrite an existing connector, you need at least `All` privileges for the `Action and Connectors` feature. If you're importing rules without actions, `Action and Connectors` feature privileges are not required. Refer to <<enable-detections-ui>> for more information.

.. Click *Import rules*.
.. Drag and drop the file that contains the detection rules.
+
NOTE: Imported rules must be in an `.ndjson` file.
.. (Optional) Select *Overwrite existing detection rules with conflicting "rule_id"* to update existing rules if they match the `rule_id` value of any rules in the import file. Configuration data included with the rules, such as actions, is also overwritten.
.. (Optional) Select *Overwrite existing exception lists with conflicting "list_id"* to replace existing exception lists with exception lists from the import file if they have a matching `list_id` value.
.. (Optional) Select *Overwrite existing connectors with conflicting action "id"* to update existing connectors if they match the `action id` value of any rule actions in the import file. Configuration data included with the actions is also overwritten.
.. Click *Import rule*.
.. (Optional) If a connector is missing sensitive information after the import, a warning displays and you're prompted to fix the connector. In the warning, click *Go to connector*. On the Connectors page, find the connector that needs to be updated, click *Fix*, then add the necessary details.
