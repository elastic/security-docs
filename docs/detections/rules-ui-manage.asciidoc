You can sort the rules by clicking the *Rule*, *Last updated*, or *Enabled* column header.

On the Rules page, you can:

* <<load-prebuilt-rules>>
* <<select-all-prebuilt-rules>>
* <<download-prebuilt-rules>>
* <<manage-rules-ui>>
* <<import-export-rules-ui>>
* <<troubleshoot-signals>>

[[load-prebuilt-rules]]
=== Load and activate prebuilt Elastic rules

To load the {es-sec-app}'s <<prebuilt-rules, prebuilt rules>>, go to *Detect -> Rules -> Load Elastic prebuilt rules and Timeline templates*).

You can then activate whichever rules you want. If you delete any prebuilt rules, a button appears that enables you to reload all of the deleted ones.

[NOTE]
==============
Apart from the Elastic Endpoint rule, prebuilt rules are not activated by
default. If you want to modify a prebuilt rule, you must first duplicate it, then make your changes to the duplicated rule. All Elastic prebuilt rules are tagged with the word `Elastic`.

To learn how to enable detection rules in Elastic Security, watch the <<enable-detection-rules, tutorial>> at the end of this topic.

=== Modify existing rules

You can clone, edit, activate, deactivate, and delete rules:

. Go to *Detect* -> *Rules*.
. Do one of the following:
* Click the *All actions* icon (*...*) on the appropriate row, then select the required action.
* In the *Rule* column, select all the rules you want to modify, then select the
required action from the *Bulk actions* menu.
. To activate or deactivate a rule, click the *Activated* toggle button.

NOTE: For prebuilt rules, you can only activate, deactivate, delete, edit

[[import-export-rules-ui]]
=== Export and import rules

You can export detection rules to an `.ndjson` file, which you can then import into another {elastic-sec} environment. The following configuration items are also included in the `.ndjson` file:

* Actions
* Exception lists

[IMPORTANT]
=================
Although detection rule actions are included in the exported file, the connectors used by the actions are not included. Use the {kibana-ref}/managing-saved-objects.html#managing-saved-objects-export-objects[Saved Objects] UI in Kibana (*Stack Management* -> *Kibana* -> *Saved Objects*) to export and import any necessary connectors _before_ you export and import the detection rules.

Similarly, any value lists used for rule exceptions are not included in rule exports or imports. Use the <<edit-value-lists, Upload value lists>> UI (*Detect* -> *Rules* -> *Upload value lists*) to export and import value lists separately.
=================

To export and import detection rules:

. Go to *Detect* -> *Rules*.
. To export rules:
.. In the All rules table, select the rules you want to export.
.. Select *Bulk actions* -> *Export selected*, then save the exported file.
+
NOTE: You cannot export Elastic prebuilt rules.
. To import rules:
+
NOTE: You need at least `Read` privileges for the `Action and Connectors` feature to import rules with actions. If you're importing rules without actions, `Action and Connectors` feature privileges are not required. Refer to <<enable-detections-ui>> for more information.

.. Click *Import rules*.
.. Drag and drop the file that contains the detection rules.
+
NOTE: Imported rules must be in an `.ndjson` file.
.. (Optional) Select *Overwrite existing detection rules with conflicting "rule_id"* to update existing rules if they match the `rule_id` value of any rules in the import file. Configuration data included with the rules, such as actions, is also overwritten.
.. (Optional) Select *Overwrite existing exception lists with conflicting "list_id"* to replace existing exception lists with exception lists from the import file if they have a matching `list_id` value.
.. Click *Import rule*.
