[[load-prebuilt-rules]]
=== Load and activate prebuilt Elastic rules

To load the {es-sec-app}'s <<prebuilt-rules, prebuilt rules>>, click
*Load Elastic prebuilt rules* on the *Rules* page (*Detect* -> *Rules* ->
*Load Elastic prebuilt rules and Timeline templates*).

You can then activate whichever rules you want. If you delete any of the prebuilt rules, a button appears that enables you to reload all of the deleted ones.

[NOTE]
==============
Apart from the Elastic Endpoint rule, prebuilt rules are not activated by
default. If you want to modify a prebuilt rule, you must first duplicate it
and then make your changes to the duplicated rule. All Elastic prebuilt rules are tagged with the word `Elastic`.

To learn how to enable detection rules in Elastic Security, watch the <<enable-detection-rules, tutorial>> at the end of this topic.
