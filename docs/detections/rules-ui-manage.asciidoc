[[load-prebuilt-rules]]
=== Load and activate prebuilt Elastic rules

To load the {es-sec-app}'s <<prebuilt-rules, prebuilt rules>>, click
*Load Elastic prebuilt rules* on the *Detection rules* page (*Security* ->
*Detections* -> *Manage detection rules* ->
*Load Elastic prebuilt rules and timeline templates*).

You can then activate whichever rules you want. If you delete any of the
prebuilt rules, a button appears that enables reloading all the deleted
ones.

[NOTE]
==============
Apart from the Elastic Endpoint rule, prebuilt rules are not activated by
default. If you want to modify a prebuilt rule, you must first duplicate it
and then make your changes to the duplicated rule.

All Elastic prebuilt rules are tagged with the word `Elastic`.
