[[rule-monitoring-visualizations]]
== Visualization data and types

The dashboard presents a variety of information about your detection rules. Visualizations display and calculate data within the time range and filters selected at the top of the dashboard.

The dashboard also includes data from all {kib} spaces. To display data only from specific spaces, open the dashboard in {kib} (*Analytics* -> *Dashboard*) and use the *Kibana space* drop-down filter.

The following visualizations are included:

* *Rule KPIs (key performance indicators)*: The total number of rules enabled, how many times they collectively ran, and their response statuses.
* *Executions by rule type*: Rule executions over time, broken down by rule type.
* *Executions by status*: Rule executions over time, broken down by status.
* *Total rule execution duration*: How long rules take to run, from start to finish.
* *Rule schedule delay*: The delay between a rule's scheduled start time and when it actually starts running.
* *Search/query duration*: How long rules take to query source indices or data views.
* *Indexing duration*: How long rules take to generate alerts and write them to the `.alerts-security.alerts-*` index.
* *Top 10 rules*: Lists of the overall slowest rules, most delayed rules, and rules with the most *Failed* and *Warning* response statuses.
