== Histograms

Time-based histograms show the number of detections, alerts, and events that have occurred within the selected time range. To focus on a particular time, click and drag to select a time range, or choose a preset value. The *Stack by* menu lets you select which field is used to organize the data. For example, in the Alert trend histogram, stack by `kibana.alert.rule.name` to display alert counts by rule name within the specified time frame.

TIP: Many {elastic-sec} histograms, graphs, and tables contain an *Inspect* button so you can examine the {es} queries used to retrieve data throughout the app.

== Host and network events
