= The Kubernetes dashboard: Linux session data from your Kubernetes clusters

This page explains how to deploy a https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/[DaemonSet] to collect session data from your Kubernetes clusters using the {endpoint-cloud-sec} integration, and how to view that data in {kib}'s Kubernetes dashboard. The collected data includes Kubernetes-specific information and Linux process data that can help you quickly understand where, how, and why your infrastructure is generating alerts.

== Setup
**Prerequisites**:

- You need an active {fleet-guide}/fleet-overview.html[{fleet} Server].
- This feature requires Elastic Stack version 8.4 or higher. Your Elastic deployment must have the {endpoint-cloud-sec} integration {security-guide}/install-endpoint.html[enabled].
- The Elastic Agent policy where you use the {endpoint-cloud-sec} integration must have `Include session data` set to `true`. To modify this setting, go to **Security -> Manage -> Policies**, select your policy, and find `Include session data` near the bottom of the `Policy settings` tab:

**Support matrix**: This feature is currently available on GKE and EKS using Linux hosts and Kubernetes versions that match the following specifications.
|=====================
| | **Kubernetes versions** | **Container runtime** | **Node OSes**
|**EKS**| 1.18; 1.19; 1.20; 1.21| Docker | Amazon Linux 2, Bottlerocket OS
|**GKE**| Regular (default channel): 1.21 and 1.22; Stable: 1.20 and 1.21; Rapid: 1.22 and 1.23 | containerd | Container-optimized OS (COS), Ubuntu
|=====================

=== Download and modify the DaemonSet manifest
The DaemonSet integrates Elastic Endpoint into your Kubernetes cluster. The Elastic Agent is enrolled to a running Fleet Server using the `FLEET_URL` parameter, and connected to a specific Elastic Agent policy using the `FLEET_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN`.

You first need to download the DaemonSet manifest `.yaml`, then modify it to include your {fleet} URL and Enrollment Token before you deploy it to the clusters you want to monitor.

1. Download the DaemonSet manifest http://github.com/elastic/placeholder[here] for GKE or http://github.com/elastic/placeholder[here] for EKS.
2. Fill in the manifest's `FLEET_URL` field with your {fleet} server's `Host URL`. To find it, go to **{kib} -> Management -> {fleet} -> Settings**. For more information, refer to {fleet-guide}/fleet-settings.html[Fleet UI settings].
3. Fill in the manifest's `FLEET_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN` field with a Fleet enrollment token. To find one, go to **{kib} -> Management -> {fleet} -> Enrollment tokens**. For more information, refer to {fleet-guide}/fleet-enrollment-tokens.html[Fleet enrollment tokens].

=== Apply the modified manifest to your cluster or clusters

To ensure you install Endpoint on the desired k8s cluster(s), use `kubectl config use-context <name-of-context>` to set the default context. You can repeat the following process for multiple contexts.

NOTE: To check which contexts exist, use `kubectl config get-contexts` to list them from your local kubectl config file. An asterisk, if present, indicates the current default context.

To apply the manifest to a cluster, run for example:
- EKS: `kubectl apply -f eks-elastic-security.yaml`
- GKE: `kubectl apply -f gke-elastic-security.yaml`

To check the DaemonSetâ€™s status, run for example: `kubectl get pods -A`

Once the DaemonSet is running, Elastic Endpoint will start sending Linux session data from Kubernetes to {kib}. You can then view that data from the Kubernetes dashboard.

== The Kubernetes dashboard
To find the dashboard, go to **Security -> Dashboards -> Kubernetes**.

The numbered sections are described below:

  1. The charts at the top of the dashboard provide an overview of your monitored Kubernetes infrastructure. You can hide them by clicking *Hide charts*.
  2. The tree navigation menu allows you to navigate through your deployments and select the scope of the Sessions table to the right. You can select any item in the menu to show its sessions. In Logical view, the menu is organized by Cluster, Namespace, Pod, and Container image. In Infrastructure view, it is organized by Cluster, Node, Pod, and Container image.
  3. The sessions table displays sessions collected from the selected element of your Kubernetes infrastructure. You can view it in fullscreen by selecting the button in the table's upper right corner, and sort it by any of its fields.

You can filter the data using the KQL search bar and date picker at the top of the page. From the sessions table's Actions column, you can take the following investigative actions:

- View details
- <<timelines-ui,Open in Timeline>>
- <<alerts-run-osquery, Run Osquery>>
- <<visual-event-analyzer, Analyze event>>
- <<session-view, Open Session View>>

IMPORTANT: This dashboard uses data from the `logs-*` index pattern, which is included by default in the <<advanced-settings,`securitySolution:defaultIndex` advanced setting>>. To collect data from multiple {es} clusters (as in a cross-cluster deployment), update `logs-*` to `*:logs-*`.

== Kubernetes-specific data in Session View

Session view displays Kubernetes-specific metadata under the *Metadata* tab of the Detail panel:

image::metadata-tab.png[The Detail panel's metadata tab]

The *Metadata* tab is organized into these expandable sections:

- `Metadata`: `hostname`, `id`, `ip`, `mac`, `name`, Host OS information
- `Cloud`: `instance.name`, `provider`, `region`, `account.id`, `project.id`
- `Container`: `id`, `name`, `image.name`, `image.tag`, `image.hash.all`
- `Orchestrator`: `resource.ip`, `resource.name`, `resource.type`, `namespace`, `cluster.id`, `cluster.name`, `parent.type`
