The {security-app}'s default dashboards provide useful visualizations of your security environment. To view them in {elastic-sec}, select *Dashboards* from the navigation menu.
From the Dashboards page, you can access the default dashboards, as well as create and access custom dashboards.

To create a new custom dashboard, click **Create Dashboard**. You can control which custom dashboards appear in the table:

* Use the text search field to filter by name or description.
* Use the **Tags** menu to filter by tag.
* Click a custom dashboard's tags to toggle filtering for each tag.

To create a new tag or edit existing tags, open the **Tags** menu and click **Manage tags**.
