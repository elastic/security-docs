= Data Quality dashboard

The Data Quality dashboard shows you whether your data is effectively mapped to the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-reference.html[Elastic Common Schema] (ECS). Successful {ref}/mapping.html[mapping] enables you to search, visualize, and interact with your data throughout {es-sec} and {kib}.

You can use the Data Quality dashboard to:

* Check one or multiple indices (by default, the indices used by {es-sec}) for unsuccessful mappings, to help you identify problems.
* View detailed information about the fields in checked indices.
* Track unsuccessful mappings by creating a case or markdown report based on Data Quality results.

NOTE: The Data Quality dashboard does not show data from cold or frozen {ref}/data-tiers.html[data tiers].

== Check indices
When you open the dashboard, data does not appear until you select which indices to check.

*Check multiple indices:*
To check all indices in the current data view, click *Check all* at the top of the dashboard. A progress indicator will appear.

*Check a single index:*
To check a single index, expand it using the arrow on the left. Checking a single index is faster than checking all indices.

== View detailed information about the fields in a checked index.
After an index is checked, either an *X* (❌) or a *checkmark* (✅) appears in its *Result* column. To view index details, including which fields were not successfully mapped, click the arrow to the left of the result.

== Track unsuccessful mappings by creating a case or markdown report based on Data Quality results

You can share data quality results to help track your team's remediation tasks. First, follow the instructions above under *Check indices* to generate results, then either:

*Share results for all indices in the current data view:*

. Click *Take action* at the top of the dashboard.
. Select either *Add to new case* to open the Create new case flyout, or click *Copy to clipboard* to copy a markdown report to your clipboard.

*Share results for one index:*

. First, expand an index by clicking the arrow to the left of its *Result*.
. From the *Summary* or *Incompatible fields* tabs, select either *Add to new case* to open the Create new case flyout, or click *Copy to clipboard* to copy a markdown report to your clipboard.

NOTE: For more information about how to remediate unsuccessful mappings, refer to {ref}/mapping.html[mapping].
