= Data Quality dashboard

The Data Quality dashboard shows you whether your data is correctly mapped to the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-reference.html[Elastic Common Schema] (ECS). Successful {ref}/mapping.html[mapping] enables you to search, visualize, and interact with your data throughout {elastic-sec} and {kib}.

Use the Data Quality dashboard to:

* Check one or multiple indices for unsuccessful mappings, to help you identify problems (the indices used by {elastic-sec} appear by default).
* View the amount of data stored in each of your indices.
* View detailed information about the fields in checked indices.
* Track unsuccessful mappings by creating a case or Markdown report based on data quality results.

NOTE: The Data Quality dashboard doesn't show data from cold or frozen {ref}/data-tiers.html[data tiers]. It also doesn't display data from remote clusters using cross-cluster search. To view data from another cluster, log in to that cluster's {kib} instance.

To use the Data Quality dashboard, you need at least the following {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices[privileges] for each index you want to check:

* `monitor` or `manage` (required for the {ref}/indices-stats.html[Index stats API])
* `view_index_metadata` or `manage_ilm` (required for the {ref}/ilm-explain-lifecycle.html[Explain lifecycle API])
* `view_index_metadata` or `manage` (required for the {ref}/indices-get-mapping.html[Get mapping API])
* `read` (required for the {ref}/search-search.html[Search API])

[[data-quality-dash-check-indices]]
== Check indices
When you open the dashboard, data does not appear until you select indices to check.

* *Check multiple indices*: To check all indices in the current data view, click *Check all* at the top of the dashboard. A progress indicator will appear.

IMPORTANT: To customize which indices are checked when you click *Check all*, {security-guide}/data-views-in-sec.html[change the current data view].

* *Check a single index*: To check a single index, expand it using the arrow on the left. Checking a single index is faster than checking all indices.

[discrete]
== Visualize checked indices
The treemap that appears at the top of the dashboard shows the relative size of your indices. The color of each index's node refers to its status:

* *Blue:* Not yet checked.
* *Green:* Checked, no incompatible fields found.
* *Red:* Checked, one or more incompatible fields found.

Click a node in the treemap to expand the corresponding index.

[discrete]
== Learn more about checked index fields
After an index is checked, an X (❌) or a checkmark (✅) appears in its *Result* column. The X (❌) indicates mapping problems in an index. To view index details, including which fields weren't successfully mapped, click the arrow next to the result to expand it.

When you expand a result, the *Summary* tab immediately helps you visualize the status of fields in that index. The other tabs display more details about particular fields, grouped by their mapping status.  

NOTE: Fields in the *Same family* category have the correct search behavior, but might have different storage or performance characteristics (for example, you can index strings to both `text` and `keyword` fields). To learn more, refer to {ref}/mapping-types.html[Field data types].

== Export data quality results

You can share data quality results to help track your team's remediation efforts. First, follow the instructions under <<data-quality-dash-check-indices, Check indices>> to generate results, then either:

* Export results for all indices in the current data view:
. At the top of the dashboard, under the *Check all* button, are two buttons that allow you to share results. Exported results include all the data which appears in the dashboard.
. Click *Add to new case* to open a new <<cases-overview,case>>.
. Click *Copy to clipboard* to copy a Markdown report to your clipboard.

* Export results for one index:
. Expand an index that has at least one incompatible field by clicking the arrow to the left of its *Result*.
. From the *Summary* or *Incompatible fields* tab, select *Add to new case* to open a new <<cases-overview,case>>.
. From the *Summary*, *Incompatible fields*, or *Same family* tab, click *Copy to clipboard* to copy a Markdown report to your clipboard.

NOTE: For more information about how to fix mapping problems, refer to {ref}/mapping.html[Mapping].
