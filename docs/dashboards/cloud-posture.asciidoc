The first row of cards (Cloud Posture Score, Failed Findings, and Open Cases) summarizes your overall cloud security posture by aggregating data from all monitored Kubernetes clusters. Each subsequent row summarizes the posture of an individual Kubernetes cluster.

The Cloud Posture Score card shows the percentage of your findings that passed over time. Hover your mouse to see precisely when the data was collected.

The Failed Findings card shows failed findings grouped by Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmark categories. Click any section name to view its failed findings on the <<kspm, Findings page>>.
