= Investigating events in Timeline

Use Timeline as your workspace for investigations and threat hunting.
Data from multiple indices can be added to a Timeline, which enables
investigating complex threats.

You can drag or send items of interest to Timeline to create the query you need
to investigate an alert or event. You can add items from tables and histograms
on the *Overview*, *Detections*, *Hosts* and *Network* pages, as well as from
within a Timeline itself. Additionally, you can add a query directly in Timeline
(click `+ Add field`).

Timelines are responsive, and they persist as you move through the {es-sec-app}
collecting data. Auto-saving ensures that the results of your investigation are
available for review by other analysts and incident response teams. To record
and share your findings with others, attach your Timeline to a
<<cases-overview, case>>.

TIP: An untitled Timeline is saved as a draft. To attach a Timeline to a
<<cases-overview, case>>, you must give it a title.

In addition to Timelines, you can create and attach Timeline templates to
<<detection-engine-overview, detection rules>>. Timeline templates allow you to
define the source event fields used when you investigate a detections alert in
Timeline. You can select whether the fields use predefined values or values
from the alert. For more information, see <<timeline-templates-ui>>.

[[refine-timeline-results]]
== View and refine Timeline results

Using the drop-down options
by the KQL bar, you can select whether <<det-engine-terminology, alerts>>,
other raw events, or both are displayed in the Timeline.

[[conf-timeline-display]]
== Configure Timeline event context and display

Many events in Timeline are presented in easy-to-follow rendered views that
include relevant contextual information. These views are called
*Event Renderers*, and they can be configured via the Settings icon in the upper
left corner of the result's pane:

The example above displays a flow event renderer. If you see a particular item
that interests you, you can drag it to the dropzone for further investigation.

Other display options include:

* View in full screen mode
* Add, remove, reorder, and resize columns
* Add notes to individual events
* Add investigation notes for the entire Timeline
* Pin interesting events in the Timeline

[[narrow-expand]]
== Narrow or expand your query

You can specify logical `AND` and `OR` operations with an item's placement in
the drop area. Multiple horizontal filters use `AND` logic, vertical filters use
`OR`.

[discrete]
[[pivot]]
== Pivot on a data point

Click a filter to access additional operations such as exclude, temporarily
disable, or delete items from the query. For example, you can change an included
item so that it is excluded.

[[timeline-to-cases-ui]]
== Attach Timeline to a case

To attach a Timeline to a new or existing case, click the Settings in the upper
right corner, and then select one of these:

* _Attach timeline to new case_
* _Attach timeline to existing case_

For more information about cases, see <<cases-overview, Cases>>.

[[manage-timelines-ui]]
== Manage existing Timelines

You can view, duplicate, delete, and create templates from existing Timelines:

. Go to *Security* -> *Timelines*.

* _Create template from timeline_ (see <<timeline-templates-ui>>)
* _Duplicate timeline_
* _Delete timeline_

TIP: To perform the same action on multiple Timelines, select Timelines and
then the required action from the _Bulk actions_ menu.

[[import-export-timelines]]
== Export and import Timelines

You can import and export Timelines, which enables importing Timelines from one
{kib} space or instance to another. Exported Timelines are saved in an
http://ndjson.org[`ndjson`] file.

. Go to *Security* -> *Timelines*.
. To export Timelines, do one of the following:

* To export one Timeline, click the *All actions* icon in the relevant row and
then select _Export selected_.
* To export multiple Timelines, select all the required Timelines and then click
*Bulk actions* -> _Export selected_.

. To import Timelines, click *Import Timeline* and then select or drap-and-drop
the Timeline `ndjson` file.
