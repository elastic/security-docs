==== Potential false positives

Bucket components may be deleted by a system or network administrator. Verify
whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes
in your environment. Bucket component deletions from unfamiliar users or hosts
should be investigated. If a known behavior is causing false positives, it can
be excluded from the rule.
