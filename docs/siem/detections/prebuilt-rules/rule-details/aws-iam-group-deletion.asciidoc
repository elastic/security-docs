==== Potential false positives

A resource group may be deleted by a system administrator. Verify whether the
user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes in your
environment. Resource group deletions from unfamiliar users or hosts should be
investigated. If a known behavior is causing false positives, it can be
excluded from the rule.
