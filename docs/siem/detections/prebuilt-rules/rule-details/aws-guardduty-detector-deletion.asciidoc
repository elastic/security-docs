==== Potential false positives

The GuardDuty detector may be deleted by a system or network administrator.
Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making
changes in your environment. Detector deletions from unfamiliar users or hosts
should be investigated. If a known behavior is causing false positives, it can
be excluded from the rule.
