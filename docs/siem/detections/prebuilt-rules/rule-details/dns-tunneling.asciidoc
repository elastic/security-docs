[[dns-tunneling]]
=== DNS Tunneling

Detects unusually large numbers of DNS queries for a single top-level DNS
domain, which is often used for DNS tunneling. DNS tunneling can be used for
command-and-control, persistence, or data exfiltration activity. For example,
`dnscat` tends to generate many DNS questions for a top-level domain as it uses
the DNS protocol to tunnel data.
