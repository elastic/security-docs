==== Potential false positives

Network ACL's may be created by a network administrator. Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment. Network ACL creations from unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.
