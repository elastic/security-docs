==== Potential false positives

A log stream may be deleted by a system administrator. Verify whether the user
identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes in your
environment. Log stream deletions from unfamiliar users or hosts should be
investigated. If a known behavior is causing false positives, it can be
excluded from the rule.
