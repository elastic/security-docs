=== Unusual Network Destination Domain Name

A machine learning job detected an unusual network destination domain name. This
can be due to initial access, persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration
activity. For example, when a user clicks on a link in a phishing email or opens
a malicious document, a request may be sent to download and run a payload from
an uncommon web server name. When malware is already running, it may send
requests to an uncommon DNS domain the malware uses for command-and-control
communication.

==== Potential false positives

Web activity that occurs rarely in small quantities can trigger this alert. Possible examples are browsing technical support or vendor URLs that are used very sparsely. A user who visits a new and unique web destination may trigger this alert when the activity is sparse. Web applications that generate URLs unique to a transaction may trigger this when they are used sparsely. Web domains can be excluded in cases such as these.
