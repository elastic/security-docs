==== Potential false positives

Clusters may be deleted by a system administrator. Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment. Cluster deletions from unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.
