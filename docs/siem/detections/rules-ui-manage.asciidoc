== Managing detection rules

On the Detection rules page, you can:

* <<load-prebuilt-rules>>
* <<select-all-prebuilt-rules>>
* <<import-export-rules-ui>>
* <<troubleshoot-signals>>

[[load-prebuilt-rules]]
=== Load and activate prebuilt Elastic rules

To load the {es-sec-app}'s <<prebuilt-rules, prebuilt rules>>, click
*Load Elastic prebuilt rules* on the *Detection rules* page (*Security* -> 
*Detections* -> *Manage detection rules* ->
*Load Elastic prebuilt rules and timeline templates*).

You can then activate whichever rules you want. If you delete any of the
prebuilt rules, a button appears that enables reloading all the deleted
ones.

[NOTE]
==============
Apart from the Elastic Endpoint rule, prebuilt rules are not activated by
default. If you want to modify a prebuilt rule, you must first duplicate it
and then make your changes to the duplicated rule. <<filter-rule-process>>
provides a detailed example of duplicating and modifying a rule.

All Elastic prebuilt rules are tagged with the word `Elastic`.
