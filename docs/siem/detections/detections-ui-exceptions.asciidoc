== Rule exceptions and value lists

To prevent the creation of unwanted alerts, you can add exceptions to detection
rules. Exceptions contain the source event conditions that determine when
alerts are not generated. They provide a convenient way of allowing trusted
processes and network activity to function without producing unnecessary noise.

You can add multiple exceptions to one rule.

IMPORTANT: When you add an exception to the
<<endpoint-rule-exceptions, Elastic Endpoint Security>> rule, you can select to
add the exception to the Endpoint. When selected, the exception is added to
both the detection rule *and* the Elastic Endpoint agent on your hosts.

In addition to defining exception queries for source event values, rule
exceptions can be used with value lists. Value lists are lists of items with
the same {es} {ref}/mapping-types.html[data type]. You can create value lists
with these types:

* `keyword` (many {ecs-ref}/ecs-field-reference.html[ECS fields] are keywords)
* `ip`
* `ip_range`
* `text`

After creating value lists, you can use `is in list` and `is not in list`
operators to define exceptions.

=== Manage value lists

To create a value list for use with exceptions:

. Prepare a `txt` or `csv` file with all the values you want to use for
determining exceptions from a single list. If you use a `txt` file, newlines
act as value delimiters.
+
NOTE: All values in the file must be of the same {es} type.

. Go to *Security* -> *Detections* -> *Manage detection rules*.
. Click *Upload value lists*.
+
The *Upload value lists* window opens.

. Select the list type (`Keywords`, `IP addresses`, `IP ranges`, or
`Text`)
. Drag or select the `csv` or `txt` file that contains the values.
. Click *Upload list*.

NOTE: When the name of the file you are uploading already exists, the values in
the new file are appended to the previously uploaded values.

To view, delete, or export existing lists:

. Go to *Security* -> *Detections* -> *Manage detection rules*.
. In the *Value lists* pane, click the required action icon.

[[detection-rule-exceptions]]
=== Add detection exceptions to a rule

You can add exceptions to a rule via the Rule details page or the Alerts table.
When you add an exception, you can also close all alerts that meet the
exception's criteria.

IMPORTANT: When you select to close all alerts that meet the exception's
criteria, all matching alerts are closed, *including* alerts generated by other
rules.

. To add an exception via the Rule details page:
.. Go to the Rule details page of the rule to which you want to add the
exception (*Security* -> *Detections* -> *Manage detection rules* ->
<rule name>).
.. Scroll down to the *Trend* histogram and select the *Exceptions* tab.
.. Click *Add new exception*.
. To add an exception via the Alerts table:
.. Go to Detections (*Security* -> *Detections*).
.. Scroll down to the Alerts table and click the more actions icon, and then
select *Add exception*.
+
The *Add Exception* window opens (via Alerts table).
+

. Add conditions that define when the exception prevents alerts. You can define
multiple conditions with `OR` and `AND` relationships. In the example above,
the exception prevents the rule from generating alerts when the
`maintenance.exe` process runs on `win-server-1`, `win-server-2`, or
`win-server-3`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
============
You can use nested conditions. However, this is only required for
<<nested-field-list, these fields>>. For all other fields, nested conditions
should not be used. 
============
+
If you have created value lists, you can use them to exclude or include all
values in a list with `is in list` and `is not in list` operators:
+

NOTE: When using a list, all exception statements must use `is in list` and
`is not in list` operators.

. You can select any of the following:

* _Close this alert_: Closes the alert when the exception is added. This option
is only available when adding exceptions via the Alerts table.
* _Close all alerts that match this exception, including alerts generated by other rules_:
Closes all alerts that match the exception's conditions.

. Click *Add Exception*.

[[endpoint-rule-exceptions]]
=== Add Elastic Endpoint Security exceptions

Like detection rule exceptions, you can add Endpoint agent exceptions via both
the Elastic Endpoint Security rule and its generated alerts. 

[IMPORTANT]
=============
Exceptions added to the Elastic Endpoint Security rule affect all alerts sent
from the Endpoint agent. Be careful not to unintentionally prevent some Endpoint
alerts.
=============

. To add an Endpoint exception via the Rule details page:
.. Go to the Rule details page and select the Elastic Security Endpoint rule
(*Security* -> *Detections* -> *Manage detection rules* ->
*Elastic Endpoint Security*).
.. Scroll down to the *Trend* histogram and select the *Exceptions* tab.
.. Click *Add Endpoint exception*.
. To add an exception via the Alerts table:
.. Go to Detections (*Security* -> *Detections*).
.. Scroll down to the Alerts table and, from an Elastic Security Endpoint
alert, click the more actions icon, and then select *Add Endpoint exception*.
+
The *Add Endpoint Exception* window opens (via Alerts table).
+

. If required, modify the conditions.
+
NOTE: <<ex-nested-conditions>> describes when nested conditions are required.

. You can select any of the following:

* _Close this alert_: Closes the alert when the exception is added. This option
is only available when adding exceptions via the Alerts table.
* _Close all alerts that match this exception, including alerts generated by other rules_:
Closes all alerts that match the exception's conditions. 

. Click *Add Exception*.
+
An exception is created for both the detection rule *and* the Elastic Endpoint
agent.

[[ex-nested-conditions]]
=== Exceptions with nested conditions

Some Endpoint objects contain nested fields, and the only way to ensure you are
excluding the correct fields is with nested conditions. One example is the
`process.Ext` object:

[source, json]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "ancestry": [],
  "code_signature": {
    "trusted": true,
    "subject_name": "LFC",
    "exists": true,
    "status": "trusted"
  },
  "user": "WDAGUtilityAccount",
  "token": {
    "elevation": true,
    "integrity_level_name": "high",
    "domain": "27FB305D-3838-4",
    "user": "WDAGUtilityAccount",
    "elevation_type": "default",
    "sid": "S-1-5-21-2047949552-857980807-821054962-504"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------


TIP: `code_signature.subject_name` refers to the process signature not the
process name.

[[nested-field-list]]
Only these objects require nested conditions to ensure the exception functions
correctly:

* `Endpoint.policy.applied.artifacts.global.identifiers`
* `Endpoint.policy.applied.artifacts.user.identifiers`
* `Target.dll.Ext.code_signature`
* `Target.process.Ext.code_signature`
* `Target.process.Ext.token.privileges`
* `Target.process.parent.Ext.code_signature`
* `Target.process.thread.Ext.token.privileges`
* `dll.Ext.code_signature`
* `file.Ext.code_signature`
* `file.Ext.macro.errors`
* `file.Ext.macro.stream`
* `process.Ext.code_signature`
* `process.Ext.token.privileges`
* `process.parent.Ext.code_signature`
* `process.thread.Ext.token.privileges`
