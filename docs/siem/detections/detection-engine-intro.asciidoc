= Detections and Alerts (beta)

beta[]

The Detections page is used to create and manage detection rules, and view the
alerts these rules create. Detection rules periodically search indices (such as
`endgame-*` and `filebeat-*`) for suspicious source events, and detection
alerts are created when a rule's conditions are met. When a detection alert
is created, its status is `Open`. To help track investigations, an alert's
status can be set as `Open`, `In progress`, or `Closed` (see
<<detection-alert-status>>).

In the {es-sec-app}, you can <<rules-ui-create, create your own rules>> and use
<<prebuilt-rules, prebuilt detection rules>> that search for suspicious
activity on your network and hosts. For information on how to use the prebuilt
rules, see <<load-prebuilt-rules>>. Once the prebuilt rules are loaded and
running, <<tuning-detection-signals>> and <<detections-ui-exceptions>> explain
how to modify the rules to reduce false positives and get a better set of
actionable alerts. You can also use exceptions and value lists when creating or
modifying your own rules.

There are two special prebuilt rules you need to know about:

* *Elastic Endpoint*: This rule automatically creates a detections alert from
all incoming Elastic Endpoint alerts. To receive Elastic Endpoint alerts, you
must install the Endpoint agent on your hosts (BEN: see xref).
+
NOTE: When you load the prebuilt rules, this is the only rule that is enabled
by default.

* *External Alerts*: This rule automatically creates a detections alert for all incoming third-party system alerts (for example, Suricata alerts).

If you want to be notified via external systems, such as Slack or email, when
detection alerts are created, you can use the {kib}
{kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html[Alerting and Actions] framework.

NOTE: To use {kib} Alerting for detection alert notifications, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license].

After detection rules are enabled, you can monitor their executions to verify
they are running correctly, and view, manage, and troubleshoot alerts (see
<<alerts-ui-manage>> and <<alerts-ui-monitor>>).

You can can create and manage detection rules and alerts via the UI or the
<<rule-api-overview, Detections API>>.

== Terminology

Detection rules::
Perform background tasks to detect suspicious activity. There are a few types of
rules:

* *Query rules*: Searches the defined indices and creates a detections alert
when a source event matches the rule's query.
* *{ml-cap} rules*: Create a detections alert when a {ml} job discovers an
anomaly score above a rule's defined threshold (see <<machine-learning>>).
* *Threshold rules*: Searches the defined indices and creates a detections alert
when the number of times the specified field's value meets the threshold during
a single execution. When there are multiple values that meet the threshold, an
alert is generated for each value.
+
For example, if the threshold `field` is `source.ip` and its `value` is `10`, an
alert is generated for every source IP address that appears in at least 10 of
the rule's search results.

Detection alerts::
Always refer to {es-sec} produced detections. Detection alerts are never
received from external systems. When a rule's conditions are met, the
{es-sec-app} writes a detection alert to an Elasticsearch `signals` index.
+
[NOTE]
==============
Detection alert indices are created for each {kib} space. The naming convention
is: `.siem-signals-<space name>`. For the default space, the signals index is
named `.siem-signals-default`.
==============

External alerts::
Always refer to alerts the {es-sec-app} receives from external systems, such as 
Suricata.

Actions::
Used to send notifications via other systems when a detections alert is
created, such as email, Slack, PagerDuty, and Webhook.

[[detections-permissions]]
== Detections configuration and index privilege prerequisites

If you are using an *on-premises* {stack} deployment:

* HTTPS must be configured for communication between
{kibana-ref}/configuring-tls.html#configuring-tls-kib-es[{es} and {kib}].
* In the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file, set the 
`xpack.security.enabled` setting to `true`. For more information, see 
{ref}/settings.html[Configuring {es}] and
{ref}/security-settings.html[Security settings in {es}].
* In the `kibana.yml` {kibana-ref}/settings.html[configuration file], add the 
`xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey` setting with any alphanumeric value 
of at least 32 characters. For example:
+
`xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey: 'fhjskloppd678ehkdfdlliverpoolfcr'`

For *all* deployments (on-premises and hosted):

* To view detection rules and alerts, you must have at least:
** `read` permissions for the `.siem-signals-<space name>` index, where
`<space name>` is the name of the {kib} space you are using to view Detections
(see {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices[Indices privileges]).
** {kib} space `Read` privileges for the `Security` feature (see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges]).
* To create and modify detection rules, you must have:
** {kib} space `All` privileges for the `Security` feature (see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges]).
** Write permissions for the `.siem-signals-<space name>` index, such as 
`create` `create_doc`, `write`, `index`, and `all`
(see {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices[Indices privileges]).

=== Resolve UI error messages

Depending on your privileges and whether a `.siem-signals-<space name>` index 
has already been created for the {kib} space, you might see an error message 
when you try to open the *Detections* page.

*`Letâ€™s set up your detection engine`*

If you see this message, a user with these privileges must visit the 
*Detections* page before you can view detection rules and alerts:

* The `manage` cluster privilege (see {ref}/security-privileges.html[{es} security privileges]).
* The `create_index` index privilege (see {ref}/security-privileges.html[{es} security privileges]).
* {kib} space `All` privileges for the `Security` feature (see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges]).

NOTE: For *on-premises* {stack} deployments only, this message may be displayed 
when the
<<detections-permissions, `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey`>> 
setting has not been added to the `kibana.yml` file.

*`Detection engine permissions required`*

If you see this message, you do not have the
<<detections-permissions, required privileges>> to view the *Detections* page, 
and you should contact your {kib} administrator.

NOTE: For *on-premises* {stack} deployments only, this message may be
displayed when the <<detections-permissions, `xpack.security.enabled`>>
setting is not enabled in the `elasticsearch.yml` file.
