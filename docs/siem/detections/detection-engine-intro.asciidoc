= Detections and Alerts (beta)

beta[]

Use the Detections feature to create and manage rules, and view the alerts
these rules create. Rules periodically search indices (such as `endgame-*` and
`filebeat-*`) for suspicious source events, and create alerts when a rule's
conditions are met. When an alert is created, its status is `Open`. To help
track investigations, an alert's status can be set as `Open`, `In progress`, or
`Closed` (see <<detection-alert-status>>).

In addition to creating <<rules-ui-create, your own rules>>, enable
<<load-prebuilt-rules, Elastic prebuilt rules>> to immediately start detecting
suspicious activity. For detailed information on all the prebuilt rules, see the
<<prebuilt-rules>> section. Once the prebuilt rules are loaded and
running, <<tuning-detection-signals>> and <<detections-ui-exceptions>> explain
how to modify the rules to reduce false positives and get a better set of
actionable alerts. You can also use exceptions and value lists when creating or
modifying your own rules.

There are two special prebuilt rules you need to know about:

* *Elastic Endpoint Security*: Automatically creates an alert from all incoming
Elastic Endpoint alerts. To receive Elastic Endpoint alerts, you must install
the Endpoint agent on your hosts (BEN: see xref).
+
When this rule is enabled, the following Endpoint events are displayed as
detection alerts:
+
** Malware Prevention Alert
** Malware Detection Alert
+
NOTE: When you load the prebuilt rules, this is the only rule that is enabled
by default.

* *External Alerts*: Automatically creates an alert for all incoming
third-party system alerts (for example, Suricata alerts).

If you want to receive notifications via external systems, such as Slack or
email, when alerts are created, use the {kib}
{kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html[Alerting and Actions] framework.

NOTE: To use {kib} Alerting for detection alert notifications, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license].

After rules have started running, you can monitor their executions to verify
they are functioning correctly, as well as view, manage, and troubleshoot
alerts (see <<alerts-ui-manage>> and <<alerts-ui-monitor>>).

You can create and manage rules and alerts via the UI or the
<<rule-api-overview, Detections API>>.

[IMPORTANT]
==============
To make sure you can access Detections and manage rules, see 
<<detections-permissions>>.

[[det-engine-terminology]]
== Terminology

Actions::
Sends notifications via other systems when a detection alert is created, such
as email, Slack, PagerDuty, and Webhook.

Detection alerts::
{es-sec} produced alerts. Detection alerts are never received from external
systems. When a rule's conditions are met, {es-sec} writes a detection alert to
an Elasticsearch `.signals` index.
+
[NOTE]
==============
Detection alert indices are created for each {kib} space. The naming convention
is: `.siem-signals-<space name>`. For the default space, the alerts index is
named `.siem-signals-default`.
==============

Detection rules::
Background tasks that run periodically and produce alerts when suspicious
activity is detected.

Endpoint exceptions::
<<term-exceptions, Exceptions>> added to both rules and Endpoint agents on
hosts. Endpoint exceptions can only be added when:

* Endpoint agents are installed on the hosts.
* The Elastic Endpoint Security rule is activated.

[[term-exceptions]]
Exceptions::
Added to rules to prevent specific source event field values from generating
alerts.

External alerts::
Alerts {es-sec} receives from external systems, such as Suricata.

[[detections-permissions]]
== Detections configuration and index privilege prerequisites

If you are using an *on-premises* {stack} deployment:

* HTTPS must be configured for communication between
{kibana-ref}/configuring-tls.html#configuring-tls-kib-es[{es} and {kib}].
* In the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file, set the 
`xpack.security.enabled` setting to `true`. For more information, see 
{ref}/settings.html[Configuring {es}] and
{ref}/security-settings.html[Security settings in {es}].
* In the `kibana.yml` {kibana-ref}/settings.html[configuration file], add the 
`xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey` setting with any alphanumeric value 
of at least 32 characters. For example:
+
`xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey: 'fhjskloppd678ehkdfdlliverpoolfcr'`

For *all* deployments (on-premises and hosted):

* To view detection rules and alerts, you must have at least:
** `read` permissions for the `.siem-signals-<space name>` index, where
`<space name>` is the name of the {kib} space you are using to view Detections
(see {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices[Indices privileges]).
** {kib} space `Read` privileges for the `Security` feature (see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges]).
* To create and modify detection rules, you must have:
** {kib} space `All` privileges for the `Security` feature (see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges]).
** Write permissions for the `.siem-signals-<space name>` index, such as 
`create` `create_doc`, `write`, `index`, and `all`
(see {ref}/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices[Indices privileges]).

=== Resolve UI error messages

Depending on your privileges and whether a `.siem-signals-<space name>` index 
has already been created for the {kib} space, you might see an error message 
when you try to open the *Detections* page.

*`Let’s set up your detection engine`*

If you see this message, a user with these privileges must visit the 
*Detections* page before you can view detection rules and alerts:

* The `manage` cluster privilege (see {ref}/security-privileges.html[{es} security privileges]).
* The `create_index` index privilege (see {ref}/security-privileges.html[{es} security privileges]).
* {kib} space `All` privileges for the `Security` feature (see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges]).

NOTE: For *on-premises* {stack} deployments only, this message may be displayed 
when the
<<detections-permissions, `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey`>> 
setting has not been added to the `kibana.yml` file.

*`Detection engine permissions required`*

If you see this message, you do not have the
<<detections-permissions, required privileges>> to view the *Detections* page, 
and you should contact your {kib} administrator.

NOTE: For *on-premises* {stack} deployments only, this message may be
displayed when the <<detections-permissions, `xpack.security.enabled`>>
setting is not enabled in the `elasticsearch.yml` file.
