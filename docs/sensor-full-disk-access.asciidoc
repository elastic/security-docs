Elastic Endpoint Security requires full disk access to protect you from malware and other cybersecurity threats. Full Disk Access permissions is a new privacy feature introduced in macOS Mojave (10.14) that prevents some applications from accessing your data. This means you need to manually grant permission for Elastic Endpoint Security to access these protected areas of your Mac.

1. Open the **System Preferences** application.

2. Click **Security and Privacy**. On the Security and Privacy panel, select the **Privacy** tab.
+
3. In the left pane, select **Full Disk Access**.
