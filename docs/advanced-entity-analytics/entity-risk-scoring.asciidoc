Entity risk scoring is an advanced {elastic-sec} analytics feature that helps security analysts detect changes in an entity's risk posture, hunt for new threats, and prioritize incident response.

Entity risk scoring allows you to monitor risk score changes of hosts and users in your environment. When generating advanced scoring analytics, the risk scoring engine utilizes threats from its end-to-end XDR use cases, such as SIEM, cloud, and endpoint. It leverages the Elastic SIEM detection engine to generate host and user risk scores from the last 30 days.

It also generates risk scores on a recurring interval, and allows for easy onboarding and management. The engine is built to factor in risks from all {elastic-sec} use cases, and allows you to customize and control how and when risk is calculated.
