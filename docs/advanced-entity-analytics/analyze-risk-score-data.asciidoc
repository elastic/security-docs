= View and analyze risk score data

The {security-app} provides several options to monitor the change in the risk posture of hosts and users from your environment. Use the following places in the {security-app} to view and analyze risk score data:

* <<entity-analytics-dashboard, Entity Analytics dashboard>>
* <<alerts-page, Alerts page>>
* <<alert-details-flyout, Alert details flyout>>
* <<hosts-users-pages, Hosts and Users pages>>

Use the Alerts table to investigate and analyze host and user risk levels and scores. We recommend adding the `user.risk.calculated_level` and `host.risk.calculated_level` columns to the Alerts table to easily display this data. To do this, select **Fields**, search for `user.risk` and `host.risk`, then select the appropriate fields from the list. Learn more about <<customize-the-alerts-table, customizing the Alerts table>>.
