[[analyze-risk-score-data]]
= View and analyze risk score data

The {security-app} provides several options to monitor the change in the risk posture of hosts and users from your environment. Use the following places in the {security-app} to view and analyze risk score data:

* <<entity-analytics-dashboard, Entity Analytics dashboard>>
* <<alerts-page, Alerts page>>
* <<alert-details-flyout, Alert details flyout>>
* <<hosts-users-pages, Hosts and Users pages>>
* <<host-user-details-pages, Host and user details pages>>
* <<host-and-user-details-flyouts, Host and user details flyouts>>

TIP: We recommend that you prioritize <<alert-triaging, alert triaging>> to identify anomalies or abnormal behavior patterns.

[[entity-analytics-dashboard]]
== Entity Analytics dashboard

From the Entity Analytics dashboard, you can access entity key performance indicators (KPIs), risk scores, and levels. You can also click the number link in the **Alerts** column to investigate and analyze the alerts on the Alerts page.

[[alert-triaging]]
== Alert triaging 
You can prioritize alert triaging to analyze alerts associated with risky or business-critical entities using the following features in the {security-app}. 

[discrete]
[[alerts-page]]
=== Alerts page

Use the Alerts table to investigate and analyze:

* Host and user risk levels
* Host and user risk scores
* Asset criticality

To display entity risk score and asset criticality data in the Alerts table, select **Fields**, and add the following:

* `user.risk.calculated_level` or `host.risk.calculated_level`
* `user.risk.calculated_score_norm` or `host.risk.calculated_score_norm`
* `user.asset.criticality` or `host.asset.criticality`

[[triage-alerts-associated-with-high-risk-or-business-critical-entities]]
==== Triage alerts associated with high-risk or business-critical entities

To analyze alerts associated with high-risk or business-critical entities, you can filter or group them by entity risk level or asset criticality level.

NOTE: If you change the entity's criticality level after an alert is generated, that alert document will include the original criticality level and will not reflect the new criticality level.

* Use the drop-down filter controls to filter alerts by entity risk level or asset criticality level. To do this, <<drop-down-filter-controls, edit the default controls>> to filter by:

** `user.risk.calculated_level` or `host.risk.calculated_level` for entity risk level:
+

** `user.asset.criticality` or `host.asset.criticality` for asset criticality level:

* To group alerts by entity risk level or asset criticality level, select **Group alerts by**, then select **Custom field** and search for:

** `host.risk.calculated_level` or `user.risk.calculated_level` for entity risk level:

** `host.asset.criticality` or `user.asset.criticality` for asset criticality level:

... Expand a risk level group (for example, **High**) or an asset criticality group (for example, **high_impact**).
... Select **Sort fields** â†’ **Pick fields to sort by**.
... Select fields in the following order:
.... `host.risk.calculated_score_norm` or `user.risk.calculated_score_norm`: **High-Low**
.... `Risk score`: **High-Low**
.... `@timestamp`: **New-Old**
