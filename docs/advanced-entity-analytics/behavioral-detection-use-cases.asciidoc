= Behavioral detection use cases

Behavioral use cases detect potential insider and external threats based on observed user actions and host activities. These use cases employ a threat-centric approach to flag deviations or suspicious activities by analyzing patterns, anomalies, and context enrichment. 

Elastic builds behavioral detection use cases on its foundational SIEM detection capabilities, leveraging {ml} algorithms and AI to enable proactive threat detection and hunting.
