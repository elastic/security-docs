To use the <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityDetectionEngineOverview">Detections feature</DocLink>, you first need to
configure a few settings. You also need the appropriate role to send
<DocLink id="serverlessSecurityRulesUiCreate" section="set-up-alert-notifications-optional">notifications</DocLink> when detection alerts are generated.

Additionally, there are some <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityDetectionsPermissionsSection" section="configure-list-upload-limits">advanced settings</DocLink> used to
configure <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityValueListsExceptions">value list</DocLink> upload limits.

{/* We're removing a lot of the information below because it's only relevant to classic, but retaining it for reference. We will replace it with serverless-specific equivalents once that information is available and useable. */}
## Enable and access detections
To use the Detections feature, it must be enabled and you must have the appropriate role to access rules and alerts. If your role does not have the privileges needed to enable this feature, you can request someone who has these privileges to visit your Security project{/* Kibana space */}, which will turn it on for you. {/* The following table describes the required privileges to access the Detections page, including rules and alerts. */}

{/* The reference to the Detections page might be a bug in classic and serverless docs. Might need to change it to Alerts and Rules, or something different like "pages that use the Detections feature". If update this para, will need to update the table below as well. */}

### Authorization

Rules, including all background detection and the actions they generate, are authorized using an [API key](((kibana-ref))/api-keys.html) associated with the last user to edit the rule. Upon creating or modifying a rule, an API key is generated for that user, capturing a snapshot of their privileges. The API key is then used to run all background tasks associated with the rule including detection checks and executing actions.

<DocCallOut title="Important" color="warning">

If a rule requires certain privileges to run, such as index privileges, keep in mind that if a user without those privileges updates the rule, the rule will no longer function.

{/* Hiding the section below as it does not sound possible in serverless yet. But might be enabled soonish, so don't want to remove it entirely. */}

## Configure list upload limits

You can set limits to the number of bytes and the buffer size used to upload
<DocLink id="serverlessSecurityValueListsExceptions">value lists</DocLink> to ((elastic-sec)).

To set the value:

1. Open `kibana.yml` [configuration file](((kibana-ref))/settings.html) or edit your
    ((kib)) cloud instance.

1. Add any of these settings and their required values:
   * `xpack.lists.maxImportPayloadBytes`: Sets the number of bytes allowed for
    uploading ((elastic-sec)) value lists (default `9000000`, maximum
    `100000000`). For every 10 megabytes, it is recommended to have an additional 1
    gigabyte of RAM reserved for Kibana.

     For example, on a Kibana instance with 2 gigabytes of RAM, you can set this value up to 20000000 (20 megabytes).

   * `xpack.lists.importBufferSize`: Sets the buffer size used for uploading
    ((elastic-sec)) value lists (default `1000`). Change the value if you're
    experiencing slow upload speeds or larger than wanted memory usage when
    uploading value lists. Set to a higher value to increase throughput at the
    expense of using more Kibana memory, or a lower value to decrease throughput and
    reduce memory usage.
