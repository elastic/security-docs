== Update a deprecated ServiceNow connector

{sn} ITSM and SecOps connectors created in {stack} version 7.15.0 or earlier are marked as deprecated after you upgrade to version 7.16.0 or later. Deprecated connectors have a yellow icon after their name and display a warning message when selected.

IMPORTANT: Deprecated connectors will continue to function with the rules they were added to and can be assigned new rules. Deprecated connectors will also continue to function with the cases that they were assigned to, but cannot be assigned to new ones. It is strongly recommended to update deprecated connectors or create new ones to ensure you have access to connector enhancements, such as updating incidents.
