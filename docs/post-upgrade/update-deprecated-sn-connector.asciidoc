== Update a deprecated ServiceNow connector

{sn} ITSM and SecOps connectors created in 7.15, or an earlier version, will be marked as deprecated after you upgrade to 7.16. Deprecated connectors will have a yellow icon at the end of their name and display a warning message if you select them.

IMPORTANT: Deprecated connectors will continue to function with the rules and cases they were added to, but you cannot assign a deprecated connector to a new rule or case. If you try to do so, you will be prompted to update the connector or create a new one.

=== Prerequisites
Before creating a new {sn} ITSM or SecOps connector, you must complete the following within your {sn} instance:

* Install Elastic for ITSM or Elastic for Security Operations (SecOps) from the https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home[ServiceNow Store].
* Create a {sn} integration user and assign it the appropriate roles. 
* Create a CORS rule. 

*Create a {sn} integration user*

To ensure authenticated communication between Elastic and {sn}, create a {sn} integration user and assign it the appropriate roles.

. Go to System *Security -> Users*. 
. Click *New*. 
. Complete the form. 
. Assign the integration user the following roles:  
** `import_set_loader`
** `import_transformer`
** `personalize_choices`
** `sn_si.basic`
** `x_elas2_sir_int.integration_user`

*Create a CORS rule*

A CORS rule is required for communication between the Elastic and {sn}.

To create a CORS rule:

. Go to *System Web Services -> CORS Rules*.
. Click *New*.
** *REST API*: Choose `x_elas2_sir_int/elastic_api`.
** *Domain*: Enter the Kibana URL.
. Go to the *HTTP methods* tab and select *GET*. This chooses the GET HTTP method.
. Click *Submit* to create the rule.
