[[findings-page-what-are-findings]]
== What are KSPM findings?

KSPM findings indicate whether a given resource passed or failed evaluation against a specific security guideline. Each finding includes metadata about the resource evaluated and the security guideline used to evaluate it. Each finding's result (`pass` or `fail`) indicates whether a particular part of your infrastructure meets a security guideline.

[[findings-page-group-filter]]
== Group and filter findings
By default, the Findings page lists all findings, without grouping or filtering.

[discrete]
=== Group findings by resource

. Select *Group by* -> *Resource* to display a list of resources sorted by their total number of failed findings.
. Click a resource ID to display the findings associated with that resource.

[[findings-page-filter-findings]]
=== Filter findings
You can filter findings data in two ways:

* *The KQL search bar*: For example, search for `result.evaluation : failed` to view all failed findings.
* *In-table value filters*: Hover over a finding to display available inline actions. Use the Filter In (plus) and Filter Out (minus) buttons.

[[kspm-customize-the-findings-table]]
=== Customize the Findings table
Use the toolbar buttons in the upper-left of the Findings table to customize the columns you want displayed:

* **Columns**: Select which columns to display.
* **_x_ fields sorted**: Sort the table by one or more columns.

[[findings-page-remediate-findings]]
== Remediate failed findings
To remediate failed findings and reduce your attack surface:

. First, <<cspm-findings-page-filter-findings,filter for failed findings>>.
. Click the arrow to the left of a failed finding to open the findings flyout.
. Follow the steps under *Remediation*.

NOTE: Remediation steps typically include commands for you to execute. These sometimes contain placeholder values that you must replace before execution.

[[kspm-create-rule-from-finding]]
== Generate alerts for failed Findings
You can create detection rules that detect specific failed findings directly from the Findings page.

. Click the arrow to the left of a Finding to open the findings flyout.
. Click **Take action**, then **Create a detection rule**. This automatically creates a detection rule that creates alerts when the associated benchmark rule generates a failed finding.
. To review or customize the new rule, click **View rule**.
