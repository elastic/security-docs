The Benchmark Integrations page lets you view the cloud security posture (CSP) benchmark rules for the <<cspm, Cloud security posture management>> (CSPM) and <<kspm, Kubernetes security posture management>> (KSPM) integrations.

Benchmark rules are used by these integrations to identify configuration risks in your cloud infrastructure. Benchmark rules are based on the Center for Internet Security's (CIS) https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/[secure configuration benchmarks].

Each benchmark rule checks to see if a specific type of resource is configured according to a CIS Benchmark. The names of rules describe what they check, for example:

* `Ensure Kubernetes Secrets are encrypted using Customer Master Keys (CMKs) managed in AWS KMS`
* `Ensure the default namespace is not in use`
* `Ensure IAM policies that allow full "*:*" administrative privileges are not attached`
* `Ensure the default namespace is not in use`


When benchmark rules are evaluated, the resulting <<findings-page, findings>> data appears on the <<cloud-posture-dashboard, Cloud Security Posture dashboard>>.

To find the Benchmark Integrations page, go to **Rules -> Benchmark rules**. From there, you can view the benchmark rules associated with an existing integration by clicking the integration name.

You can then click on a benchmark rule's name to see details, including information about how to remediate failures and related links.

NOTE: Benchmark rules are not editable.

== How benchmark rules work

. When a security posture management integration is deployed, and every four hours after that, {agent} fetches relevant cloud resources.
. After resources are fetched, they are evaluated against all applicable benchmark rules.
. Finding values of `pass` or `fail` indicate whether the standards defined by benchmark rules were met.
