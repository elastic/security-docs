The Findings page shows how your Kubernetes clusters' configuration measures up to the standards defined on the <<benchmark-rules, CSP Benchmarks page>>.

Findings are organized by the resource IDs of the associated Kubernetes infrastructure and include data about the infrastructure and benchmark rules. Each finding's result (`pass` or `fail`) indicates whether a particular part of your Kubernetes infrastructure meets an active CSP benchmark rule.

You can filter table data by entering queries into the KQL search bar.
