[[findings-page-what-are-findings]]
=== What are findings?

Findings indicate whether Kubernetes resources passed or failed evaluation against benchmark rules. Each finding includes metadata about the resource evaluated and the benchmark rule used to evaluate it.
Each finding's result (`pass` or `fail`) indicates whether a particular part of your Kubernetes infrastructure meets a benchmark rule.

[[findings-page-filter-findings]]
==== Filter findings
You can filter findings data in two ways:

* *The KQL search bar*: For example, search for `result.evaluation : failed` to view all failed findings.
* *In-table value filters*: Hover over a finding to display available inline actions. Use the Filter In (plus) and Filter Out (minus) buttons.
