The summary cards at the top of the dashboard display the number of monitored cloud accounts, scanned virtual machines (VMs), and vulnerabilities (grouped by severity).

The *Trend by severity* bar graph complements the summary cards by displaying the number of vulnerabilities found on your infrastructure over time, sorted by severity. It has a maximum time scale of 30 days.
