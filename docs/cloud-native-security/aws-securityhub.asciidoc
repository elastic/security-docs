= Ingest AWS Security Hub data

In order to enrich your {elastic-sec} workflows with third-party cloud security posture data collected by AWS Security Hub:

* Follow the steps to {integrations-docs}/aws/securityhub[set up the AWS Security Hub integration]. 

* Make sure the integration version is at least xx.xx. 

* Ensure you have `read` privileges for the following indices: `security_solution-*.misconfiguration_latest`, `security_solution-*.vulnerability_latest`.

After you've completed these steps, AWS Security Hub data will appear on the <<cspm-findings-page, Findings>> page, on the <<cspm-posture-dashboard, Cloud Posture dashboard>>, and in the entity details flyouts for <<insights-section, alerts>>, <<user-details-flyout,users>>, and <<host-details-flyout,hosts>>.
