= Ingest AWS Security Hub data

In order to enrich your {elastic-sec} workflows with third-party cloud security posture data collected by AWS Security Hub:

* Follow the steps to {integrations-docs}/aws/securityhub[set up the AWS Security Hub integration]. 

* Make sure the integration version is at least 2.31.1. 

* Ensure you have `read` privileges for the `security_solution-*.misconfiguration_latest` index.

After you've completed these steps, AWS Security Hub data will appear on the <<cspm-findings-page, Misconfiguration Findings>> page. 

Any available findings data will also appear in the entity details flyouts for <<insights-section, alerts>>. If alerts are present for a user or host that has findings data from AWS Security Hub, the findings will appear on the <<user-details-flyout,users>>, and <<host-details-flyout,hosts>> flyouts.
