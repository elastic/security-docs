== Find captured environment variables
Captured environment variables are associated with process events, and appear in each event's `process.env_vars` field.

To view environment variables in the *Events* table:

. Click the *Event* tab on the *Hosts*, *Network*, or *Users* pages (*Security -> Explore*), then click *Fields* in the Events table.
. Search for the `process.env_vars` field, select it, and click *Close*.
A new column appears containing captured environment variable data.
