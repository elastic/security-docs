--
* This feature requires {stack} version 8.6 or higher.
* In {stack} version 8.6, this feature is only available for Linux.
--

You can configure an {agent} policy to capture up to five environment variables (`env vars`). Captured environment variables are associated with process events and recorded in the `process.env_vars` field.

[NOTE]
--
* Env var names must be no more than 63 characters, and env var values must be no more than 1023 characters. Values outside these limits are silently ignored.

* Env var names are case sensitive in Linux.
--

To set up environment variable capture for an {agent} policy:

. Go to **Manage -> Policies**.
. Select an {agent} policy.
. Click *Show advanced settings*.
. Scroll down or search for `linux.advanced.capture_env_vars`.
. Enter the names of env vars you want to capture, separated by commas. For example: `PATH,LD_PRELOAD,USER`
. Click *Save*.
