[[cspm-findings-page-what-are-findings]]
== What are CSPM findings?

CSPM findings indicate whether a given resource passed or failed evaluation against a specific security guideline. Each finding includes metadata about the resource evaluated and the security guideline used to evaluate it. Each finding's result (`pass` or `fail`) indicates whether a particular part of your infrastructure meets a security guideline.

[[cspm-findings-page-group-filter]]
== Group and filter findings
By default, the Findings page lists all findings, without grouping or filtering.

. To turn off grouping, click **Group findings by:** and select **None**.

[[cspm-findings-page-filter-findings]]
=== Filter findings
You can filter findings data in two ways:

* *The KQL search bar*: For example, search for `result.evaluation : failed` to view all failed findings.
* *In-table value filters*: Hover over a finding to display available inline actions. Use the Filter In (plus) and Filter Out (minus) buttons.

[[cspm-customize-the-findings-table]]
=== Customize the Findings table
Use the toolbar buttons in the upper-left of the Findings table to customize the columns you want displayed:

* **Columns**: Select the left-to-right order in which columns appear.
* **Sort fields** or **_n_ fields sorted**: Sort the table by one or more columns, or turn sorting off.

[[cspm-create-rule-from-finding]]
== Generate alerts for failed Findings
You can create detection rules that detect specific failed findings directly from the Findings page.

. Click the arrow to the left of a Finding to open the findings flyout.
. Click **Take action**, then **Create a detection rule**. This automatically creates a detection rule that creates alerts when the associated benchmark rule generates a failed finding.
. To review or customize the new rule, click **View rule**.
