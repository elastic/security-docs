[[d4c-get-started]]
= Get started with CWP

This page describes how to set up Container Workload Protection (CWP) for various use-cases.

[discrete]
== Initial setup (all use-cases)

First, you'll need to deploy Elastic's Defend for Containers integration to the Kubernetes clusters you wish to monitor.

. Go to *Manage > Container Workload Security > Add Defend for Containers*.
. Name the integration.
. Optional — make any desired changes to the integration's policy by adjusting the *Selectors* and *Responses* sections. (For more information, refer to the <<d4c-policy-guide, Defend for Containers policy guide>>). You can also change these later.
. Under *Where to add this integration*, select an existing or new agent policy.
. Click *Save & Continue*, then *Add {agent} to your hosts*.
. On the *Add agent* menu, select the *Kubernetes* tab.
. Download or copy the manifest (`elastic-agent-managed-kubernetes.yml`).
. Open the manifest using your favorite editor, and uncomment the `#capabilities` section:
+
```
#capabilities:
#  add:
#    - BPF # (since Linux 5.8) allows loading of BPF programs, create most map types, load BTF, iterate programs and maps.
#    - PERFMON # (since Linux 5.8) allows attaching of BPF programs used for performance metrics and observability operations.
#    - SYS_RESOURCE # Allow use of special resources or raising of resource limits. Used by 'Defend for Containers' to modify 'rlimit_memlock'
```
+
. From the directory where you saved the manifest, run the command `kubectl apply -f elastic-agent-managed-kubernetes.yml`.
. Wait for the *Confirm agent enrollment* dialogue to show that data has started flowing from your newly-installed agent, then click *Close*.

[[d4c-get-started-threat]]
[discrete]
== Get started with threat detection

One of the <<d4c-default-policies, default D4C policies>> sends process telemetry events (`fork` and `exec`) to {es}.

In order to detect threats using this data, you'll need active <<detection-engine-overview, detection rules>>. Elastic has prebuilt detection rules designed for this data. (You can also create your own <<rules-ui-create, custom rules>>.)

To install Elastic's prebuilt rules:

. Go to *Security > Manage > Rules*, and click *Load Elastic prebuilt rules and timeline templates* (this may take a few minutes).
. Once the rules have loaded, you will see the Rules management page. Use the *Tags* selector to search for `container`. Select the `Container Workload Protection` tag.
. Select all the rules with the tag, and then click *Bulk actions > Enable*.

Your CWP rules are now enabled.

[[d4c-get-started-drift]]
[discrete]
== Get started with drift detection and prevention

{elastic-sec} defines container drift as the creation of a new executable or the modification of an existing executable within a container. Blocking drift greatly restricts the number of attack vectors available to bad actors by prohibiting them from using external tools.

One of the <<d4c-default-policies, default D4C policies>> creates alerts in the Elastic SIEM when container drift is detected. Before you enable blocking, we strongly recommend that you observe a production workload using the default policy to ensure that the workload does not create or modify executables as part of its normal operation.

To enable blocking:

. Add a new selector called `blockDrift`
. Go to *Security > Manage > Container Workload Protection > Your integration name*.
. Under *Selectors*, click *Add selector > File Selector*. By default it will select the operations `createExecutable` and `modifyExecutable`.
. Name the selector, for example: `blockDrift`.
. Scroll down to the *Responses* section and click *Add response > File Response*.
. Under *Match selectors*, add the name of your new selector, for example: `blockDrift`.
. Select the *Alert* and *Block* actions.
. Click *Save integration*.

[[d4c-get-started-validation]]
[discrete]
== Policy validation
To ensure the stability of your production workloads, you should test policy changes before implementing them on production workloads. If possible, you should test policy changes on a simulated environment with workloads similar to production. This approach allows you to test that policy changes prevent undesirable behavior without disrupting your production workloads.
