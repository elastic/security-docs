## Overview
Elastic's <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityCspm">Cloud Security Posture Management</DocLink> (CSPM) and <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityKspm">Kubernetes Security Posture Management</DocLink> (KSPM) features help you discover and evaluate the services and resources in your cloud environment — like storage, compute, IAM, and more — against security guidelines defined by the Center for Internet Security (CIS). They help you identify and remediate configuration risks that could undermine the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your cloud assets, such as publicly exposed storage buckets or overly permissive networking objects.

The KSPM feature assesses the security of your Kubernetes assets, while the CSPM feature assesses the security of your AWS resources such as storage, compute, IAM, and more.
