The first row of cards (Cloud Posture Score, Failed Findings, and Open Cases) summarizes your overall cloud security posture (CSP) by aggregating data from all monitored Kubernetes clusters. Each subsequent row summarizes the posture of an individual Kubernetes cluster.

The Cloud Posture Score card shows the performance of your Kubernetes clusters on <<benchmark-rules,security benchmarks>>. Hover over the card to display when the data was collected.

The Failed Findings card shows failed findings grouped by Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmark categories. Click any section name to view its failed findings on the <<findings-page, Findings page>>.
