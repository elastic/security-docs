= Ingest Wiz data

In order to enrich your {elastic-sec} workflows with third-party cloud security posture and vulnerability data collected by Wiz:

* Follow the steps to {integrations-docs}/wiz[set up the Wiz integration]. 

* Make sure the integration version is at least xx.xx. 

* Ensure you have `read` privileges for the following indices: `security_solution-*.misconfiguration_latest`, `security_solution-*.vulnerability_latest`.

After you've completed these steps, Wiz data will appear on the <<cspm-findings-page, Misconfiguration Findings>> page, the <<cnvm-findings-page, Vulnerabilities Findings>> page, on the <<cspm-posture-dashboard, Cloud Posture dashboard>>, and in the entity details flyouts for <<insights-section, alerts>>, <<user-details-flyout,users>>, and <<host-details-flyout,hosts>>.
