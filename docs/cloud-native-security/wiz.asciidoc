= Ingest Wiz data

In order to enrich your {elastic-sec} workflows with third-party cloud security posture and vulnerability data collected by Wiz:

* Follow the steps to {integrations-docs}/wiz[set up the Wiz integration]. 

* Make sure the integration version is at least 2.0.1. 

* Ensure you have `read` privileges for the following indices: `security_solution-*.misconfiguration_latest`, `security_solution-*.vulnerability_latest`.

After you've completed these steps, Wiz data will appear on the <<cspm-findings-page, Misconfiguration Findings>> page and the <<vuln-management-findings, Vulnerabilities Findings>> page.

Any available findings data will also appear in the entity details flyouts for <<insights-section, alerts>>. If alerts are present for a user or host that has findings data from Wiz, the findings will appear on the <<user-details-flyout,users>>, and <<host-details-flyout,hosts>> flyouts.
