[[vuln-management-findings]]
= Findings

The vulnerabilities findings page displays the vulnerabilities detected by the <<vuln-management-overview, CNVM integration>>. CNVM findings include metadata such as the CVE identifier, CVSS score, severity, affected package, and fix version if available, as well as information about impacted systems.

To help you prioritize remediation efforts, you can filter and sort your findings based on these fields.

Clicking on a finding provides a detailed description of the vulnerability, and any available remediation information.

[[vuln-findings-grouping]]
== Group, sort, and filter findings

You can group your data by resource by selecting *Resource* from the *Group by* menu. When data is grouped by resource, you can click on the name of a virtual machine to view all vulnerabilities that were found on it.

When *Group by* is set to *None*, you can sort the Findings table by clicking the column headings or the *Sort fields* button to the upper left of the table. When sorting is active, the *Sort fields* button changes to *X fields sorted* (where _X_ is the number of fields sorting your data), and can be used to modify or clear sorting.

Independent of grouping, you can filter data in two ways:

- *The KQL search bar*: Use this to filter your findings. For example, search for `vulnerability.id : CVE-2019-00001` to view all findings related to a particular vulnerability.

- *In-table value filters*: Hover over a vulnerability CVE ID to display available inline actions. Use the Filter In (*+*) and Filter Out (*-*) buttons.

[[vuln-findings-learn-more]]
== Learn more about a vulnerability

Click a vulnerability to open the vulnerability details flyout. This flyout includes a link to the related vulnerability database, the vulnerability's publication date, CVSS vector strings, fix versions (if available), and more.

When you open the vulnerability details flyout, it defaults to the *Overview* tab, which highlights key information. To view every field present in the vulnerability document, select the *Table* or *JSON* tabs.

[[vuln-findings-remediate]]
== Remediate vulnerabilities

To remediate a vulnerability and reduce your attack surface, update the affected package if a fix is available.

[[cnvm-create-rule-from-finding]]
== Generate alerts for failed Findings
You can create detection rules that detect specific vulnerabilities directly from the Findings page:

. Click a vulnerability to open the vulnerability details flyout flyout.
. Click **Take action**, then **Create a detection rule**. This automatically creates a detection rule that creates alerts when the associated vulnerability is found.
. To review or customize the new rule, click **View rule**.
