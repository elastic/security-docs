[[vuln-management-findings]]
= Findings

The vulnerabilities findings page displays the vulnerabilities detected by the <<vuln-management-overview, CNVM integration>>. CNVM findings include metadata such as the CVE identifier, CVSS score, severity, affected package, and fix version if available, as well as information about impacted systems.

To help you prioritize remediation efforts, you can filter and sort your findings based on these fields. Clicking on a finding provides a detailed description of the vulnerability, and any available remediation information.

- *In-table value filters*: Hover over a vulnerability CVE ID to display available inline actions. Use the Filter In (*+*) and Filter Out (*-*) buttons.
