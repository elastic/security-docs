= Get started with CNVM

This page explains how to set up Cloud Native Vulnerability Management (CNVM).

.Requirements
[sidebar]
--
* CNVM is available to all {ecloud} users. On-premise deployments require an https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Enterprise subscription].
* Requires {stack} and {agent} version 8.8 or higher.
* CNVM only works in the `Default` {kib} space. Installing the CNVM integration on a different {kib} space will not work. 
* To view vulnerability scan findings, you need at least `read` privileges for the following indices:
** `logs-cloud_security_posture.vulnerabilities-*`
** `logs-cloud_security_posture.vulnerabilities_latest-*`
* You need an AWS user account with permissions to perform the following actions: run CloudFormation templates, create IAM Roles and InstanceProfiles, and create EC2 SecurityGroups and Instances.

NOTE: CNVM currently only supports AWS EC2 Linux workloads.

== Set up CNVM for AWS

To set up the CNVM integration for AWS, install the integration on a new {agent} policy, sign into the AWS account you want to scan, and run the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/index.html[CloudFormation] template.

IMPORTANT: Do not add the integration to an existing {agent} policy. It should always be added to a new policy since it should not run on VMs with existing workloads. For more information, refer to <<vuln-management-overview-how-it-works, How CNVM works>>.

[[vuln-management-setup-step-1]]
=== Step 1: Add the CNVM integration

. In the {security-app}, go to the **Get started** page, then click *Add security integrations*.
. Search for **Cloud Native Vulnerability Management**, then click on the result.
. Click *Add Cloud Native Vulnerability Management*.
. Give your integration a name that matches its purpose or the AWS account region you want to scan for vulnerabilities (for example, `uswest2-aws-account`.)

. Click *Save and continue*. The integration will create a new {agent} policy.
. Click *Add {agent} to your hosts*.

=== Step 2: Sign in to the AWS management console

. Open a new browser tab and use it to sign into your AWS management console.
. Switch to the cloud region with the workloads that you want to scan for vulnerabilities.

IMPORTANT: The integration will only scan VMs in the region you select. To scan multiple regions, repeat this setup process for each region.

=== Step 3: Run the CloudFormation template

. Switch back to the tab where you have {kib} open.
. Click *Launch CloudFormation*. The CloudFormation page appears.
+

+
. Click *Create stack*.  To avoid authentication problems, you can only make configuration changes to the VM InstanceType, which you could make larger to increase scanning speed.
. Wait for the confirmation that {agent} was enrolled.
. Your data will start to appear on the *Vulnerabilities* tab of the <<vuln-management-findings, Findings page>>.
