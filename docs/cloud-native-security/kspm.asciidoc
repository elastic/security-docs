[[kspm]]
= Kubernetes security posture management

The Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) integration allows you to identify security and compliance issues in the configuration of various Kubernetes components.

This integration is currently supported for use with unmanaged Kubernetes clusters, as well as clusters managed by Amazon EKS. To set it up, you'll need to first add it to an {fleet-guide}/agent-policy.html[{agent} policy], then deploy the KSPM DaemonSet to the Kubernetes clusters you want to monitor. This process differs slightly depending on whether you intend to monitor unmanaged clusters or EKS-managed clusters.
