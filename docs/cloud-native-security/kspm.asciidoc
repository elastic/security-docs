= Kubernetes security posture management

The Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) integration allows you to monitor how your Kubernetes clusters' configuration measures up to security benchmarks.

To set up the integration, you'll need to first add it to an {agent} policy, then deploy the KSPM DaemonSet to the Kubernetes clusters you want to monitor.

== Set up a KSPM integration
To install the integration:

1. Go to *Dashboards -> Cloud Posture*.
2. Click *Add a CIS integration*.
3. Click *Add Kubernetes Security Posture Management*.
4. Name your integration.
5. Select whether to use the CIS or EKS Benchmarks — use CIS unless you're deploying on EKS.
6. Select the {agent} policy where you want to add the integration.
7. Click *Save and continue*, then *Add agent to your hosts*. The *Add agent* wizard appears, and provides you a DaemonSet manifest `.yaml` with your `Fleet ID`, `Fleet URL`, and other configuration information pre-populated.

The *Add agent* wizard will help you to deploy a DaemonSet on the Kubernetes clusters you wish to monitor. To do this, for each cluster:

1. Download the manifest and make any necessary revisions to its configuration to suit the needs of your environment.
2. Apply the manifest using the `kubectl apply -f ` command, for example: `kubectl apply -f elastic-agent-managed-kubernetes.yaml`

After about a minute, the *Add agent* wizard will show “Agent enrollment confirmed”, then “Incoming data confirmed." You can then click *View assets* to see where the newly-collected configuration information appears throughout {kib}, including the <<findings-page,Findings page>> and the <<cloud-posture-dashboard, Cloud Posture dashboard>>.

== Findings page

The Findings page shows you how the configuration of your Kubernetes clusters measures up to the standards defined on the <<benchmark-rules, CSP Benchmarks page>>.

Findings are organized by the resource IDs of the associated Kubernetes infrastructure and include data about the infrastructure and benchmark rules. Each finding's result (which can be `pass` or `fail`) indicates whether a particular part of your Kubernetes infrastructure meets an active CSP benchmark rule.

You can filter table data by entering queries into the KQL search bar.
