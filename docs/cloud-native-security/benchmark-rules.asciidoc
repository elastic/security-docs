== Benchmark rules
The Benchmark Integrations page lets you view the cloud security posture (CSP) benchmark rules for your <<kspm, Kubernetes security posture management (KSPM) integrations>>. Benchmark rules define the Kubernetes configuration best practices that form the basis of the data that appears on the <<cloud-posture-dashboard, Cloud Posture dashboard>>.

To find the Benchmark Integrations page, go to **Manage -> CSP Benchmarks**. From there, to view the benchmark rules associated with an integration, select that integration's name.
