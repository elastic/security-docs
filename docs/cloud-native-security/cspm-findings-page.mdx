## What are findings?

CSPM findings indicate whether a given resource passed or failed evaluation against a specific security guideline. Each finding includes metadata about the resource evaluated and the security guideline used to evaluate it. Each finding's result (`pass` or `fail`) indicates whether a particular part of your infrastructure meets a security guideline.

## Group and filter findings
By default, the Findings page lists all findings, without grouping or filtering.

### Group findings by resource

1. Select **Group by** → **Resource** to display a list of resources sorted by their total number of failed findings.
1. Click a resource ID to display the findings associated with that resource.

<div id="cspm-findings-page-filter-findings"></div>

### Filter findings
You can filter findings data in two ways:

* **The KQL search bar**: For example, search for `result.evaluation : failed` to view all failed findings.
* **In-table value filters**: Hover over a finding to display available inline actions. Use the Filter In (plus) and Filter Out (minus) buttons.

## Customize the Findings table
Use the toolbar buttons in the upper-left of the Findings table to customize the columns you want displayed:

* **Columns**: Select which columns to display and adjust their order.
* **_x_ fields sorted**: Sort the table by one or more columns.

## Remediate failed findings
To remediate failed findings and reduce your attack surface:

1. First, <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityCspmFindingsPage" section="filter-findings">filter for failed findings</DocLink>.
1. Click the arrow to the left of a failed finding to open the findings flyout.
1. Follow the steps under **Remediation**.

    <DocCallOut title="Note">
    Remediation steps typically include commands for you to execute. These sometimes contain placeholder values that you must replace before execution.
    </DocCallOut>

## Generate alerts for failed Findings
You can create detection rules that detect specific failed findings directly from the Findings page.

1. Click the arrow to the left of a Finding to open the findings flyout.
1. Click **Take action**, then **Create a detection rule**. This automatically creates a detection rule that creates alerts when the associated benchmark rule generates a failed finding.
1. To review or customize the new rule, click **View rule**.
