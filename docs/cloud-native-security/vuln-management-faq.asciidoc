Frequently asked questions about the Cloud Native Vulnerability Management (CNVM) integration and features.


*Which security data sources does the CNVM integration use to identify vulnerabilities?*

The CNVM integration uses various security data sources. The complete list can be found https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/blob/v0.35.0/docs/docs/vulnerability/detection/data-source.md[here].

*What's the underlying scanner used by CNVM integration?*

CNVM uses the open source scanner https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy[Trivy] v0.35.

*What system architectures are supported?*

Because of Trivy's limitations, CNVM can only be deployed on ARM-based VMs. However, it can scan hosts regardless of system architecture.

*How often are the security data sources synchronized?*

The CNVM integration fetches the latest data sources at the beginning of every scan cycle to ensure up-to-date vulnerability information.

*What happens if a scan cycle does not complete within 24 hours?*

If a scan cycle doesn't finish within 24 hours, the ongoing cycle will continue until completion. When it finishes, a new cycle will immediately start.

*How is the lifecycle of snapshots handled?*

The CNVM integration manages the lifecycle of snapshots. Snapshots are automatically deleted/removed at the end of each scan cycle.

*Does CNVM have an impact on the user's cloud expenses?*

Yes, CNVM creates additional cloud expenses, since scanning involves provisioning a new virtual machine to conduct the scan.

*Does CNVM also scan the new AWS EC2 instances that it creates?*

Yes, CNVM scans all AWS EC2 instances in every scan cycle, including any created by the integration.

*Does CNVM scan AWS EC2 instances with encrypted volumes?*

Encrypted volumes can be scanned only if they were encrypted using Amazon's default EBS key, and are _not_ running Amazon Linux 2023.

*Does CNVM prevent multiple installations in a single region?*

No, CNVM does not currently prevent redundant deployment to the same region.

*What volume types and file systems does CNVM support?*

CNVM supports all AWS EBS volume types and works with `ext4` and `xfs` file systems.

*Does CNVM scan stopped EC2 instances?*

Yes, CNVM scans all EC2 instances, whether they are running or stopped, to ensure comprehensive vulnerability detection.

*What AWS permissions does the user require to run the CloudFormation template for CNVM onboarding?*

To run the CloudFormation template for CNVM onboarding, you need an AWS user account with permissions to perform the following actions: run CloudFormation templates, create IAM Roles and InstanceProfiles, and create EC2 SecurityGroups and Instances.

*Why do I get an error when I try to run the CloudFormation template?*

It's possible you're using an unsupported region. Currently the `eu-north-1` and `af-south-1` regions are not supported because they don't provide the required instance types.
