[[cspm]]
= Cloud security posture management

The Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) feature discovers and evaluates the services in your cloud environment — like storage, compute, IAM, and more — against configuration security guidelines defined by the https://www.cisecurity.org/[Center for Internet Security] (CIS) to help you identify and remediate risks that could undermine the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your cloud data.

This feature currently supports Amazon Web Services (AWS). For a step-by-step getting started guide, refer to <<cspm-get-started,Get started with CSPM>>.

[[cspm-how-it-works]]
== How CSPM works

To set up the CSPM feature, you'll install the CSPM integration for {agent} in your cloud account(s).

Using the read-only credentials you will provide during the setup process, it will evaluate the configuration of resources in your environment every 4 hours.
After each evaluation, the integration sends findings to Elastic. A high-level summary of the findings appears on the <<cloud-nat-sec-posture-dashboard,Cloud posture dashboard>>, and detailed findings appear on the <<findings-page,Findings page>>.
