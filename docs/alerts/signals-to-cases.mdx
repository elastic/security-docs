From the Alerts table, you can attach one or more alerts to a <DocLink id="serverlessSecuritySignalsToCases" section="add-alerts-to-a-new-case">new case</DocLink> or <DocLink id="serverlessSecuritySignalsToCases" section="add-alerts-to-an-existing-case">an existing one</DocLink>. Alerts from any rule type can be added to a case.

<DocCallOut title="Note">
- After you add an alert to a case, you can remove it from the case activity under the alert summary or by using the [((elastic-sec)) Cases API](((security-guide))/cases-api-overview.html).
- Each case can have a maximum of 1,000 alerts.

## Add alerts to a new case
To add alerts to a new case:

1. Do one of the following:
    * To add a single alert to a case, select the **More actions** menu (*...*) in the Alerts table or **Take action** in the alert details flyout, then select **Add to a new case**.
    * To add multiple alerts, select the alerts, then select **Add to a new case** from the **Bulk actions** menu.
1. Give the case a name, assign a severity level, and provide a description. You can use
    [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) syntax in the case description.

    <DocCallOut title="Note">
    If you do not assign your case a severity level, it will be assigned **Low** by default.
    </DocCallOut>

1. Optionally, add a category, assignees and relevant tags. You can add users only if they
    meet the necessary <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityCasePermissions">prerequisites</DocLink>.

1. Specify whether you want to sync the status of associated alerts. It is enabled by default; however, you can toggle this setting on or off at any time. If it remains enabled, the alert's status updates whenever the case's status is modified.
1. Select a connector. If you've previously added one, that connector displays as the default selection. Otherwise, the default setting is `No connector selected`.
1. Click **Create case** after you've completed all of the required fields. A confirmation message is displayed with an option to view the new case. Click the link in the notification or go to the Cases page to view the case.

## Add alerts to an existing case
To add alerts to an existing case:

1. Do one of the following:
    * To add a single alert to a case, select the **More actions** menu (*...*) in the Alerts table or **Take action** in the alert details flyout, then select **Add to existing case**.
    * To add multiple alerts, select the alerts, then select **Add to an existing case** from the **Bulk actions** menu.
1. From the **Select case** dialog box, select the case to which you want to attach the alert. A confirmation message is displayed with an option to view the updated case. Click the link in the notification or go to the Cases page to view the case's details.

    <DocCallOut title="Note">
    If you attach the alert to a case that has been configured to sync its status with associated alerts, the alert's status updates any time the case's status is modified.
