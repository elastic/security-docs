You can create user roles and define privileges to manage feature access in {elastic-sec}. This allows you to use the principle of least privilege while managing access to {elastic-defend}'s features.

Configure roles and privileges in **Stack Management** â†’ **Custom Roles**. For more details on using this UI, refer to <<custom-roles>>.

[NOTE]
====
{elastic-defend}'s feature privileges must be assigned to **All Spaces**. You can't assign them to an individual space.
====

To grant access, select **All** for the **Security** feature in the **{kib} privileges** configuration UI, then turn on the **Customize sub-feature privileges** switch. For each of the following sub-feature privileges, select the type of access you want to allow:

* **All**: Users have full access to the feature, which includes performing all available actions and managing configuration.
* **Read**: Users can view the feature, but can't perform any actions or manage configuration (some features don't have this privilege).
* **None**: Users can't access or view the feature.
