To silently install and deploy {elastic-defend} without the need for user interaction, you need to configure a mobile device management (MDM) profile for {elastic-endpoint}—the installed component that performs {elastic-defend}'s threat monitoring and prevention. This allows you to pre-approve the {elastic-endpoint} system extension and grant Full Disk Access to all the necessary components.

This page explains how to deploy {elastic-defend} silently using Jamf.
