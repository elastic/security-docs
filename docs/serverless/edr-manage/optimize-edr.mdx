If you encounter problems like incompatibilities with other antivirus software, too many false positive alerts, or excessive storage or CPU usage, you can optimize ((elastic-defend)) to mitigate these issues.

Endpoint artifacts — such as trusted applications and event filters — and Endpoint exceptions let you modify the behavior and performance of _((elastic-endpoint))_, the component installed on each host that performs ((elastic-defend))'s threat monitoring, prevention, and response actions.

The following table explains the differences between several Endpoint artifacts and exceptions, and how to use them:

      **_Prevents ((elastic-endpoint)) from monitoring a process._** Use to avoid conflicts with other software, usually other antivirus or endpoint security applications.
      
      * Creates intentional blind spots in your security environment — use sparingly!
      * Doesn't monitor the application for threats, nor does it generate alerts, even if it behaves like malware, ransomware, etc.
      * Doesn't generate events for the application except process events for visualizations and other internal use by the ((stack)).
      * Might improve performance, since ((elastic-endpoint)) monitors fewer processes.
      * Might still generate malicious behavior alerts, if the application's process events indicate malicious behavior. To suppress alerts, create <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityAddExceptions" section="add-((elastic-endpoint))-exceptions">Endpoint alert exceptions</DocLink>.

      **_Prevents event documents from being written to ((es))._** Use to reduce storage usage in ((es)).
      
      Does NOT lower CPU usage for ((elastic-endpoint)). It still monitors event data for possible threats, but without writing event data to ((es)).

      **_Prevents ((elastic-endpoint)) from generating alerts or stopping processes._** Use to reduce false positive alerts, and to keep ((elastic-endpoint)) from preventing processes you want to allow.
      
      Might also improve performance: ((elastic-endpoint)) checks for exceptions _before_ most other processing, and stops monitoring a process if an exception allows it.
