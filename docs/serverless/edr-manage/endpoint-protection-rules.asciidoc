= Endpoint protection rules

Endpoint protection rules are <<security-prebuilt-rules-management, prebuilt rules>> designed to help you manage and respond to alerts generated by {elastic-endpoint}, the installed component that performs {elastic-defend}'s threat monitoring and prevention. These rules include the Endpoint Security rule as well as additional detection and prevention rules for different {elastic-defend} protection features.

IMPORTANT: To receive {elastic-endpoint} alerts, you must install {agent} and the {elastic-defend} integration on your hosts (refer to <<security-install-edr>>).

When endpoint protection rules are triggered, {elastic-endpoint} alerts are displayed as detection alerts in the {security-app}. The detection alert name is taken from the {elastic-endpoint} alert message and overwrites the prebuilt rule name in the Alerts table. For example, for malware protection, the following {elastic-endpoint} alerts are displayed as detection alerts:

** Malware Prevention Alert
** Malware Detection Alert

== Endpoint Security rule

The Endpoint Security rule automatically creates an alert from all incoming {elastic-endpoint} alerts.

NOTE: When you install Elastic prebuilt rules, the Endpoint Security rule that is enabled by default.

[[feature-protection-rules]]
== Feature-specific protection rules

The following endpoint protection rules give you more granular control over how you handle the generated alerts. These rules are tailored for each of {elastic-defend}'s endpoint protection featuresâ€”malware, ransomware, memory threats, and malicious behavior. Enabling these rules allows you to configure more specific actions based on the protection feature and whether the malicious activity was prevented or detected.

* Behavior - Detected - Elastic Defend
* Behavior - Prevented - Endpoint Defend
* Malicious File - Detected - Elastic Defend
* Malicious File - Prevented - Elastic Defend
* Memory Signature - Detected - Elastic Defend
* Memory Signature - Prevented - Elastic Defend
* Ransomware - Detected - Elastic Defend
* Ransomware - Prevented - Elastic Defend

NOTE: If you choose to use the feature-specific protection rules, we recommend that you disable the Endpoint Security rule, as using both will result in duplicate alerts.

To use these rules, you need to manually enable them from the **Rules** page in the {security-app}. Follow the instructions for <<load-prebuilt-rules,installing and enabling Elastic prebuilt rules>>.

== Endpoint security exception handling

All endpoint protection rules share a common exception list called the Endpoint Security Exception List. This ensures that if you switch between using the Endpoint Security rule and the feature-specific protection rules, your existing <<endpoint-rule-exceptions, {elastic-endpoint} exceptions>> continue to apply.
