= Use Endpoint Insights to find incompatible AV products on your hosts


Third-party antivirus (AV) software installed on your hosts can interfere with {elastic-defend}. Issues with running third-party AV alongside {elastic-defend} can be mitigated, but first you have to identify which AV is present. 

After you've installed {elastic-defend} on one or more hosts,  you can use **Endpoint Insights** to check whether your endpoints have third-party AV software installed. Using the same kinds of LLM connectors as Elastic AI Assistant, Endpoint Insights can analyze file event logs from your hosts to determine whether antivirus software is present. From there, you can address any incompatibilities to make sure your endpoints are protected.

== Resolve incompatibilities

After a scan has completed, you can click the *Create trusted app* button to the right of a result to quickly add the associated AV program to {elastic-defend}'s trusted applications list.

To resolve incompatibilities between {elastic-defend} and third-party AV software, we recommend you either uninstall the AV software, or <<security-allowlist-endpoint, allowlist {elastic-endpoint} in your AV>> and <<security-trusted-applications,make the AV a trusted application>>.
