((elastic-sec)) supports the organization of your security operations into logical instances with the [spaces](((kibana-ref))/xpack-spaces.html) feature. Each space in ((kib)) represents a separate logical instance of ((elastic-sec)) in which detection rules, rule exceptions, value lists, alerts, Timelines, cases, and ((kib)) advanced settings are private to the space and accessible only by users that have role privileges to access the space. For details about configuring privileges for ((es)) and ((kib)), refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/detections-requirements" section="detections-permissions-section" />.

For example, if you create a `SOC_prod` space in which you load and activate all the ((elastic-sec)) prebuilt detection rules, these rules and any detection alerts they generate will be accessible only when visiting the ((security-app)) in the `SOC_prod` space. If you then create a new `SOC_dev` space, you'll notice that no detection rules or alerts are present. Any rules subsequently loaded or created here will be private to the `SOC_dev` space, and they will run independently of those in the `SOC_prod` space.

<DocCallOut title="Note">    
    By default, alerts created by detection rules are stored in ((es)) indices under the `.alerts-security.alerts-<Kibana-space>` index pattern, and they may be accessed by any user with role privileges to access those ((es)) indices. In our example above, any user with ((es)) privileges to access `.alerts-security.alerts-SOC_prod` will be able to view `SOC_prod` alerts from within ((es)) and other ((kib)) apps such as Discover. 

    To ensure that detection alert data remains private to the space in which it was created, ensure that the roles assigned to your ((elastic-sec)) users include ((es)) privileges that limit their access to alerts within their space's alerts index.
