# Connect to OpenAI

This page provides step-by-step instructions for setting up an OpenAI connector for the first time. This connector type enables you to leverage OpenAI's large language models (LLMs) within ((kib)). You'll first need to create an OpenAI API key, then configure the connector in ((kib)).

## Configure OpenAI

### Select a model

Before creating an API key, you must choose a model. Refer to the [OpenAI docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4) to select a model. Take note of the specific model name (for example `gpt-4-turbo`); you'll need it when configuring ((kib)).

<DocCallOut title="Note">
`GPT-4 Turbo` offers increased performance. `GPT-4` and `GPT-3.5` are also supported.
</DocCallOut>

### Create an API key

To generate an API key:

1. Log in to the OpenAI platform and navigate to **API keys**.
2. Select **Create new secret key**.
3. Name your key, select an OpenAI project, and set the desired permissions.
4. Click **Create secret key** and then copy and securely store the key. It will not be accessible after you leave this screen.

The following video demonstrates these steps.

## Configure the OpenAI connector

To integrate with ((kib)):

1. Log in to ((kib)).
2. Navigate to **Stack Management → Connectors → Create Connector → OpenAI**.
3. Provide a name for your connector, such as `OpenAI (GPT-4 Turbo Preview)`, to help keep track of the model and version you are using.
4. Under **Select an OpenAI provider**, choose **OpenAI**.
5. The **URL** field can generally be left unchanged.
6. Enter the API key that you previously created in the corresponding field.
7. Click **Save**.

The following video demonstrates these steps.
