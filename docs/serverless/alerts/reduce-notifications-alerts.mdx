      **_Stops a specific rule's notification actions from running_**. 
      
      Use to avoid unnecessary notifications from a specific rule. The rule continues to run and generate alerts during the snooze period, but its <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-create" section="set-up-alert-notifications-optional">notification actions</DocLink> don't run.

    <DocCell>
      **_Prevents all rules' notification actions from running_**. 
      
      Use to avoid false alarms and unnecessary notifications during planned outages. All rules continue to run and generate alerts during the maintenance window, but their <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-create" section="set-up-alert-notifications-optional">notification actions</DocLink> don't run.

      **_Reduces repeated or duplicate alerts_**. 
      
      Use to reduce the number of alerts created when a rule meets its criteria repeatedly. Duplicate qualifying events are grouped, and only one alert is created for each group.

      **_Prevents a rule from creating alerts under specific conditions_**.
      
      Use to reduce false positive alerts by preventing trusted processes and network activity from generating unnecessary alerts. You can configure an exception to be used by a single rule or shared among multiple rules, but they typically don't affect _all_ rules.
