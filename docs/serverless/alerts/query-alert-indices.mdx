This page explains how you should query alert indices, for example, when building rule queries, custom dashboards, or visualizations. For more information about alert event field definitions, review the <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/alert-schema">Alert schema</DocLink>.

## Alert index aliases
We recommend querying the `.alerts-security.alerts-<space-id>` index alias. You should not include a dash or wildcard after the space ID. To query all spaces, use the following syntax: `.alerts-security.alerts-*`.

## Alert indices
For additional context, alert events are stored in hidden ((es)) indices. We do not recommend querying them directly. The naming convention for these indices and their aliases is `.internal.alerts-security.alerts-<space-id>-NNNNNN`, where `NNNNNN` is a number that increases over time, starting from 000001.
