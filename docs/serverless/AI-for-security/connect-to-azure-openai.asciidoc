This page provides step-by-step instructions for setting up an Azure OpenAI connector for the first time. This connector type enables you to leverage large language models (LLMs) within {kib}. You'll first need to configure Azure, then configure the connector in {kib}.

=== Configure a deployment

First, set up an Azure OpenAI deployment:

. Log in to the Azure console and search for Azure OpenAI.
. In **Azure AI services**, select **Create**.
. For the **Project Details**, select your subscription and resource group. If you don't have a resource group, select **Create new** to make one.
. For **Instance Details**, select the desired region and specify a name, such as `example-deployment-openai`.
. Select the **Standard** pricing tier, then click **Next**.
. Configure your network settings, click **Next**, optionally add tags, then click **Next**.
. Review your deployment settings, then click **Create**. When complete, select **Go to resource**.

The following video demonstrates these steps.

=== Configure a model

Now, set up the Azure OpenAI model:

. From within your Azure OpenAI deployment, select **Model deployments**, then click **Manage deployments**.
. On the **Deployments** page, select **Create new deployment**.
. Under **Select a model**, choose `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4 turbo`.
. Set the model version to "Auto-update to default".
. Under **Deployment type**, select **Standard**.
. Name your deployment.
. Slide the **Tokens per Minute Rate Limit** to the maximum. The following example supports 80,000 TPM, but other regions might support higher limits.
. Click **Create**.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The models available to you will depend on https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#model-summary-table-and-region-availability[region availability]. For best results, use `GPT-4o 2024-05-13` with the maximum Tokens-Per-Minute (TPM) capacity. For more information on how different models perform for different tasks, refer to the <<security-llm-performance-matrix,LLM performance matrix>>.

Finally, configure the connector in {kib}:

. Log in to {kib}.
. Go to **Stack Management → Connectors → Create connector → OpenAI**.
. Give your connector a name to help you keep track of different models, such as `Azure OpenAI (GPT-4 Turbo v. 0125)`.
. For **Select an OpenAI provider**, choose **Azure OpenAI**.
. Update the **URL** field. We recommend doing the following:
+
** Navigate to your deployment in Azure AI Studio and select **Open in Playground**. The **Chat playground** screen displays.
** Select **View code**, then from the drop-down, change the **Sample code** to `Curl`.
** Highlight and copy the URL without the quotes, then paste it into the **URL** field in {kib}.
** (Optional) Alternatively, refer to the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference[API documentation] to learn how to create the URL manually.
. Under **API key**, enter one of your API keys.
. Click **Save & test**, then click **Run**.
