[[review-single-osquery-results]]

Results for single queries appear on the **Results** tab. When you run a query, the number of agents queried and query status temporarily display in a status bar above the results table. Agent responses can be `Successful`, `Not yet responded` (pending), and `Failed`.

== Investigate query results

From the results table, you can:

* Click **View in Discover** (image:images/icons/discoverApp.svg[View in Discover app]) to explore the results in Discover.
* Click **View in Lens** (image:images/icons/lensApp.svg[View in Lens app]) to navigate to Lens, where you can use the drag-and-drop **Lens** editor to create visualizations.
* Click **Timeline** (image:images/icons/timeline.svg[Timeline]) to investigate a single query result in Timeline or **Add to timeline investigation** to investigate all results. This option is only available for single query results.

When you open all results in Timeline, the events in Timeline are filtered based on the `action_ID` generated by the Osquery query.
* Click **Add to Case** (image:images/icons/casesApp.svg[Cases]) to add the query results to a new or existing case. If you ran a live query from an alert, the alert and query results are added to the case as comments.
* Click the view details icon (image:images/icons/expand.svg[View details]) to examine the query ID and statement.
* View more information about the request, such as failures, by opening the **Status** tab.
