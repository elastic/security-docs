Osquery is an open source tool that lets you use SQL to query operating systems like a database. When you add the [Osquery manager integration](((kibana-ref))/manage-osquery-integration.html) to an ((agent)) policy, Osquery is deployed to all agents assigned to that policy. After completing this setup, you can [run live queries and schedule recurring queries](((kibana-ref))/osquery.html) for agents and begin gathering data from your entire environment.

Osquery is supported for Linux, macOS, and Windows. You can use it with ((elastic-sec)) to perform real-time incident response, threat hunting, and monitoring to detect vulnerability or compliance issues. The following Osquery features are available from ((elastic-sec)):
