= Elastic Security UI

// :keywords: serverless, security, reference

The {security-app} is a highly interactive workspace designed for security analysts that provides a clear overview of events and alerts from your environment. You can use the interactive UI to drill down into areas of interest.

[[search-overview]]
== Search

Filter for alerts, events, processes, and other important security data by entering {kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language (KQL)] queries in the search bar, which appears at the top of each page throughout the app. A date/time filter set to `Today` is enabled by default, but can be changed to any time range.

* To refine your search results, select **Add Filter** (image:images/icons/plusInCircleFilled.svg[Add]), then enter the field, operator (such as `is not` or `is between`), and value for your filter.
* To save the current KQL query and any applied filters, select **Saved query menu** (image:images/icons/filterInCircle.svg[Filter]), enter a name for the saved query, and select **Save saved query**.
