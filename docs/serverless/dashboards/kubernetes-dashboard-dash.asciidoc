The Kubernetes dashboard provides insight into Linux process data from your Kubernetes clusters. It shows sessions in detail and in the context of your monitored infrastructure.

The numbered sections are described below:

. The charts at the top of the dashboard provide an overview of your monitored Kubernetes infrastructure. You can hide them by clicking **Hide charts**.
. The tree navigation menu allows you to navigate through your deployments and select the scope of the sessions table to the right. You can select any item in the menu to show its sessions. In Logical view, the menu is organized by Cluster, Namespace, Pod, and Container image. In Infrastructure view, it is organized by Cluster, Node, Pod, and Container image.
. The sessions table displays sessions collected from the selected element of your Kubernetes infrastructure. You can view it in fullscreen by selecting the button in the table's upper right corner. You can sort the table by any of its fields.

You can filter the data using the KQL search bar and date picker at the top of the page.

From the sessions table's Actions column, you can take the following investigative actions:

* View details
* <<security-timelines-ui,Open in Timeline>>
* <<security-alerts-run-osquery,Run Osquery>>
* <<security-visual-event-analyzer,Analyze event>>
* <<security-session-view,Open Session View>>

Session View displays Kubernetes metadata under the **Metadata** tab of the Detail panel:

The **Metadata** tab is organized into these expandable sections:

* **Metadata:** `hostname`, `id`, `ip`, `mac`, `name`, Host OS information
* **Cloud:** `instance.name`, `provider`, `region`, `account.id`, `project.id`
* **Container:** `id`, `name`, `image.name`, `image.tag`, `image.hash.all`
* **Orchestrator:** `resource.ip`, `resource.name`, `resource.type`, `namespace`, `cluster.id`, `cluster.name`, `parent.type`

====
This dashboard uses data from the `logs-*` index pattern, which is included by default in the <<security-advanced-settings,`securitySolution:defaultIndex` advanced setting>>. To collect data from multiple {es} clusters (as in a cross-cluster deployment), update `logs-*` to `*:logs-*`.
