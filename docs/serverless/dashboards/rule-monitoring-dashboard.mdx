The Detection rule monitoring dashboard provides visualizations to help you monitor the overall health and performance of ((elastic-sec))'s detection rules. Consult this dashboard for a high-level view of whether your rules are running successfully and how long they're taking to run, search data, and create alerts.

## Visualization data and types

The dashboard presents a variety of information about your detection rules. Visualizations display and calculate data within the time range and filters selected at the top of the dashboard.

The following visualizations are included:

* **Rule KPIs (key performance indicators)**: The total number of rules enabled, how many times they collectively ran, and their response statuses.
* **Executions by rule type**: Rule executions over time, broken down by rule type.
* **Executions by status**: Rule executions over time, broken down by status.
* **Total rule execution duration**: How long rules take to run, from start to finish.
* **Rule schedule delay**: The delay between a rule's scheduled start time and when it actually starts running.
* **Search/query duration**: How long rules take to query source indices or data views.
* **Indexing duration**: How long rules take to generate alerts and write them to the `.alerts-security.alerts-*` index.
* **Top 10 rules**: Lists of the overall slowest rules, most delayed rules, and rules with the most **Failed** and **Warning** response statuses.
