Host isolation allows you to isolate hosts from your network, blocking communication with other hosts on your network until you release the host. Isolating a host is useful for responding to malicious activity or preventing potential attacks, as it prevents lateral movement across other hosts. 

Isolated hosts, however, can still send data to ((elastic-sec)). You can also create <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/host-isolation-exceptions">host isolation exceptions</DocLink> for specific IP addresses that isolated hosts are still allowed to communicate with, even when blocked from the rest of your network.

<DocCallOut title="Requirements">

* Host isolation requires the Endpoint Protection Complete <DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/manage-project" text="project feature"/>. 

* Hosts must have ((agent)) installed with the ((elastic-defend)) integration.

* Host isolation is supported for endpoints running Windows, macOS, and these Linux distributions:

    * CentOS/RHEL 8
    * Debian 11
    * Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, and 22.04
    * AWS Linux 2

* To isolate and release hosts running any operating system, you must have the appropriate user role. {/* **Host Isolation** <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/endpoint-management-req">privilege</DocLink> */}

You can isolate a host from a detection alert's details flyout, from the Endpoints page, or from the endpoint response console. Once a host is successfully isolated, an `Isolated` status displays next to the `Agent status` field, which you can view on the alert details flyout or Endpoints list table.

<DocCallOut title="Tip">
If the request fails, verify that the ((agent)) and your endpoint are both online before trying again.
</DocCallOut>

All actions executed on a host are tracked in the host’s response actions history, which you can access from the Endpoints page. Refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/isolate-host" section="view-host-isolation-history">View host isolation history</DocLink> for more information.

## Isolate a host

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Isolate a host from a detection alert">

1. Open a detection alert:
* From the Alerts table or Timeline: Click **View details** (<DocIcon type="expand" title="View details" />).
* From a case with an attached alert: Click **Show alert details** (**>**).
1. Click **Take action → Isolate host**.
1. Enter a comment describing why you’re isolating the host (optional).
1. Click **Confirm**.

</DocAccordion>

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Isolate a host from an endpoint">

1. Go to **Assets → Endpoints**, then either:
    * Select the appropriate endpoint in the **Endpoint** column, and click **Take action → Isolate host** in the endpoint details flyout.
    * Click the **Actions** menu (*...*) on the appropriate endpoint, then select **Isolate host**.
1. Enter a comment describing why you’re isolating the host (optional).
1. Click **Confirm**.

</DocAccordion>

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Isolate a host from the response console">

<DocCallOut title="Note">
The response console requires the Endpoint Protection Complete <DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/manage-project" text="project feature"/>.
</DocCallOut>

1. Open the response console for the host (select the **Respond** button or actions menu option on the host, endpoint, or alert details view).
1. Enter the `isolate` command and an optional comment in the input area, for example:

    `isolate --comment "Isolate this host"`

1. Press **Return**.

</DocAccordion>

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Automatically isolate a host using a rule's endpoint response action">

<DocCallOut title="Note">
The host isolation endpoint response action requires the Endpoint Protection Complete <DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/manage-project" text="project feature"/>. 
</DocCallOut>

<DocCallOut title="Important" color="warning">
Be aware that automatic host isolation can result in unintended consequences, such as disrupting legitimate user activities or blocking critical business processes.
</DocCallOut>

1. Add an endpoint response action to a new or existing custom query rule. The endpoint response action will run whenever rule conditions are met: 
    * **New rule**: On the last step of <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-create" section="create-a-custom-query-rule">custom query rule</DocLink> creation, go to the **Response Actions** section and select **((elastic-defend))**.
    * **Existing rule**: Edit the rule's settings, then go to the **Actions** tab. In the tab, select **((elastic-defend))** under the **Response Actions** section.
1. Click the **Response action** field, then select **Isolate**.
1. Enter a comment describing why you’re isolating the host (optional).
1. To finish adding the response action, click **Create & enable rule** (for a new rule) or **Save changes** (for existing rules).

</DocAccordion>

After the host is successfully isolated, an **Isolated** status is added to the endpoint. Active end users receive a notification that the computer has been isolated from the network:

## Release a host

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Release a host from a detection alert">

1. Open a detection alert:
* From the Alerts table or Timeline: Click **View details** (<DocIcon type="expand" title="View details" />).
* From a case with an attached alert: Click **Show alert details** (**>**).
1. From the alert details flyout, click **Take action → Release host**.
1. Enter a comment describing why you're releasing the host (optional).
1. Click **Confirm**.

</DocAccordion>

<DocAccordion buttonContent="Release a host from an endpoint">

1. Go to **Assets → Endpoints**, then either:
    * Select the appropriate endpoint in the **Endpoint** column, and click **Take action → Release host** in the endpoint details flyout.
    * Click the **Actions** menu (*...*) on the appropriate endpoint, then select **Release host**.

</DocCallOut>

1. Open the response console for the host (select the **Respond** button or actions menu option on the host, endpoint, or alert details view).
1. Enter the `release` command and an optional comment in the input area, for example:

    `release --comment "Release this host"`

1. Press **Return**.

</DocAccordion>

After the host is successfully released, the **Isolated** status is removed from the endpoint. Active end users receive a notification that the computer has been reconnected to the network:

## View host isolation history

To confirm if a host has been successfully isolated or released, check the response actions history, which logs the response actions performed on a host.

Go to **Assets** → **Endpoints**, click an endpoint's name, then click the **Response action history** tab. You can filter the information displayed in this view. Refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/response-actions-history">Response actions history</DocLink> for more details.
