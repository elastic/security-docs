Endpoint response actions involving third-party systems require additional configuration. This page explains the high-level steps you'll need to take to enable these response actions.

<div id="configure-sentinelone-response-actions"></div>

## Configure SentinelOne response actions

You can direct SentinelOne to perform response actions on protected hosts, such as isolating a suspicious endpoint from your network, without needing to leave the ((elastic-sec)) UI.

<DocCallOut template="technical_preview" />

<DocCallOut title="Prerequisites">
* <DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/manage-project">Project features add-on</DocLink>: Endpoint Protection Complete
* <DocLink slug="/serverless/general/assign-user-roles">User roles</DocLink>: **SOC manager** or **Endpoint operations analyst**
* Endpoints must have actively running SentinelOne agents installed.
</DocCallOut>

Configuration requires the following general steps. Expand the steps and follow the links for detailed instructions:

1. **Generate API access tokens in SentinelOne.** You'll need these tokens in later steps, and they allow ((elastic-sec)) to collect data and perform actions in SentinelOne.

    <DocAccordion buttonContent="Expand for details">
    Create two API tokens in SentinelOne, and give them the least privilege required by the Elastic components that will use them:
        - SentinelOne integration: Permission to read SentinelOne data.
        - SentinelOne connector: Permission to read SentinelOne data and perform actions on SentinelOne-protected hosts (for example, isolating and releasing an endpoint).
    
    Refer to the [SentinelOne integration docs](((integrations-docs))/sentinel_one) or SentinelOne's docs for details on generating API tokens.
    </DocAccordion>

1. **Install the SentinelOne integration and ((agent)).** Elastic's [SentinelOne integration docs](((integrations-docs))/sentinel_one) collects and ingests logs into ((elastic-sec)).

    <DocAccordion buttonContent="Expand for details">
        1. In ((kib)), go to **Integrations**, search for and select **SentinelOne**, then select **Add SentinelOne**.
        1. Configure the integration with an **Integration name** and optional **Description**.
        1. Ensure that **Collect SentinelOne logs via API** is selected, and enter the required **Settings**:
            - **URL**: The SentinelOne console URL.
            - **API Token**: The SentinelOne API access token you generated previously, with permission to read SentinelOne data.
        1. Scroll down and enter a name for the agent policy in **New agent policy name**. If other agent policies already exist, you can click the **Existing hosts** tab and select an existing policy instead. For more details on ((agent)) configuration settings, refer to [((agent)) policies](((fleet-guide))/agent-policy.html).
        1. Click **Save and continue**.
        1. Select **Add ((agent)) to your hosts** and continue with the <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/install-edr" section="enroll-agent">((agent)) installation steps</DocLink> to install ((agent)) on a resource in your network (such as a server or VM). ((agent)) will act as a bridge collecting data from SentinelOne and sending it back to ((elastic-sec)).
    </DocAccordion>

1. **Create a SentinelOne connector.** Elastic's [SentinelOne connector](((kibana-ref))/sentinelone-action-type.html) enables ((elastic-sec)) to perform actions on SentinelOne-protected hosts.

    <DocAccordion buttonContent="Expand for details">
        <DocCallOut color="warning" title="Important">
        Do not create more than one SentinelOne connector.
        </DocCallOut>

        1. In ((kib)), go to **Stack Management** â†’ **Connectors**, then select **Create connector**.
        1. Select the **SentinelOne** connector.
        1. Enter the configuration information:
            - **Connector name**: A name to identify the connector.
            - **SentinelOne tenant URL**: The SentinelOne tenant URL.
            - **API token**: The SentinelOne API access token you generated previously, with permission to read SentinelOne data and perform actions on SentinelOne-protected hosts.
        1. Click **Save**.
    </DocAccordion>

1. **Create and enable a rule to generate ((elastic-sec)) alerts.** Create a <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-create" section="create-custom-rule">custom query detection rule</DocLink> to generate ((elastic-sec)) alerts whenever SentinelOne generates alerts. 

    <DocAccordion buttonContent="Expand for details">
    Use these settings when creating the custom query rule to target the data collected from SentinelOne:
    - **Index patterns**: `logs-sentinel_one.alert*`
    - **Custom query**: `observer.serial_number:*`

    <DocCallOut title="Note">
    Do not include any other index patterns or query parameters.
    </DocCallOut>

    This gives you visibility into SentinelOne without needing to leave ((elastic-sec)). You can perform supported endpoint response actions directly from alerts that the rule creates, by using the **Take action** menu on the alert details flyout.
