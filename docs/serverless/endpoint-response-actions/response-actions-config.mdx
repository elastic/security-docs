You can direct third-party endpoint protection systems to perform response actions on enrolled hosts, such as isolating a suspicious endpoint from your network, without leaving the ((elastic-sec)) UI. This page explains the configuration steps needed to enable response actions for these third-party systems:

* CrowdStrike
* SentinelOne

Check out <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/third-party-actions" /> to learn which response actions are supported for each system.

<DocCallOut title="Prerequisites">
* <DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/manage-project">Project features add-on</DocLink>: Endpoint Protection Complete
* <DocLink slug="/serverless/general/assign-user-roles">User roles</DocLink>: **SOC manager** or **Endpoint operations analyst**
* Endpoints must have actively running endpoint agents installed.

Select a tab below for your endpoint security system:

    <DocTab name="CrowdStrike">
    {/* NOTE TO CONTRIBUTORS: These DocTabs have very similar content. If you change anything 
    in this tab, apply the change to the other tabs, too. */}
    To configure response actions for CrowdStrike-enrolled hosts:

    1. **Create an API client in CrowdStrike.** Refer to CrowdStrike's docs for instructions on creating an API client.

        - Give the API client the least privilege required to read CrowdStrike data and perform actions on enrolled hosts.

        - Take note of the client ID, client secret, and base URL: you'll need them in later steps when you configure ((elastic-sec)) components to access CrowdStrike.<br /><br />

    1. **Install the CrowdStrike integration and ((agent)).** Elastic's [CrowdStrike integration](((integrations-docs))/crowdstrike) collects and ingests logs into ((elastic-sec)).
        1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Integrations**, search for and select **CrowdStrike**, then select **Add CrowdStrike**.
        1. Configure the integration with an **Integration name** and optional **Description**.
        1. Select **Collect CrowdStrike logs via API**, and enter the required **Settings**:
            - **Client ID**: Client ID for your CrowdStrike API client.
            - **Client Secret**: Client secret allowing you access to CrowdStrike.
            - **URL**: The base URL of the CrowdStrike API.
        1. Select the **Falcon Alerts** and **Hosts** sub-options under **Collect CrowdStrike logs via API**.
        1. Scroll down and enter a name for the agent policy in **New agent policy name**. If other agent policies already exist, you can click the **Existing hosts** tab and select an existing policy instead. For more details on ((agent)) configuration settings, refer to [((agent)) policies](((fleet-guide))/agent-policy.html).
        1. Click **Save and continue**.
        1. Select **Add ((agent)) to your hosts** and continue with the <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/install-edr" section="enroll-agent">((agent)) installation steps</DocLink> to install ((agent)) on a resource in your network (such as a server or VM). ((agent)) will act as a bridge collecting data from CrowdStrike and sending it back to ((elastic-sec)).<br /><br />

    1. **Create a CrowdStrike connector.** Elastic's [CrowdStrike connector](((kibana-ref))/action-types.html) enables ((elastic-sec)) to perform actions on CrowdStrike-enrolled hosts.

        <DocCallOut color="warning" title="Important">
        Do not create more than one CrowdStrike connector.
        </DocCallOut>

        1. Go to **Stack Management** → **Connectors**, then select **Create connector**.
        1. Select the **CrowdStrike** connector.
        1. Enter the configuration information:
            - **Connector name**: A name to identify the connector.
            - **CrowdStrike API URL**: The base URL of the CrowdStrike API.
            - **CrowdStrike Client ID**: Client ID for your CrowdStrike API client.
            - **Client Secret**: Client secret allowing you access to CrowdStrike.
        1. Click **Save**.<br /><br />
        
    1. **Create and enable a rule to generate ((elastic-sec)) alerts.** (Optional) Create a <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-create" section="create-custom-rule">custom query detection rule</DocLink> to generate ((elastic-sec)) alerts based on CrowdStrike events and data. Use the index pattern `logs-crowdstrike*`.

        <DocCallOut title="Note">
        Do not include any other index patterns.
        </DocCallOut>

        This gives you visibility into CrowdStrike without needing to leave ((elastic-sec)). You can perform supported endpoint response actions directly from alerts that the rule creates, by using the **Take action** menu on the alert details flyout.
    </DocTab>

    <DocTab name="SentinelOne">
    {/* NOTE TO CONTRIBUTORS: These DocTabs have very similar content. If you change anything 
    in this tab, apply the change to the other tabs, too. */}
    To configure response actions for SentinelOne-enrolled hosts:

    1. **Generate API access tokens in SentinelOne.** You'll need these tokens in later steps, and they allow ((elastic-sec)) to collect data and perform actions in SentinelOne.

        Create two API tokens in SentinelOne, and give them the least privilege required by the Elastic components that will use them:
            - SentinelOne integration: Permission to read SentinelOne data.
            - SentinelOne connector: Permission to read SentinelOne data and perform actions on enrolled hosts (for example, isolating and releasing an endpoint).<br /><br />
        
        Refer to the [SentinelOne integration docs](((integrations-docs))/sentinel_one) or SentinelOne's docs for details on generating API tokens.<br /><br />

    1. **Install the SentinelOne integration and ((agent)).** Elastic's [SentinelOne integration](((integrations-docs))/sentinel_one) collects and ingests logs into ((elastic-sec)).

        1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Integrations**, search for and select **SentinelOne**, then select **Add SentinelOne**.
        1. Configure the integration with an **Integration name** and optional **Description**.
        1. Ensure that **Collect SentinelOne logs via API** is selected, and enter the required **Settings**:
            - **URL**: The SentinelOne console URL.
            - **API Token**: The SentinelOne API access token you generated previously, with permission to read SentinelOne data.
        1. Scroll down and enter a name for the agent policy in **New agent policy name**. If other agent policies already exist, you can click the **Existing hosts** tab and select an existing policy instead. For more details on ((agent)) configuration settings, refer to [((agent)) policies](((fleet-guide))/agent-policy.html).
        1. Click **Save and continue**.
        1. Select **Add ((agent)) to your hosts** and continue with the <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/install-edr" section="enroll-agent">((agent)) installation steps</DocLink> to install ((agent)) on a resource in your network (such as a server or VM). ((agent)) will act as a bridge collecting data from SentinelOne and sending it back to ((elastic-sec)).<br /><br />

    1. **Create a SentinelOne connector.** Elastic's [SentinelOne connector](((kibana-ref))/sentinelone-action-type.html) enables ((elastic-sec)) to perform actions on SentinelOne-enrolled hosts.            

            <DocCallOut color="warning" title="Important">
            Do not create more than one SentinelOne connector.
            </DocCallOut>

            1. Go to **Stack Management** → **Connectors**, then select **Create connector**.
            1. Select the **SentinelOne** connector.
            1. Enter the configuration information:
                - **Connector name**: A name to identify the connector.
                - **SentinelOne tenant URL**: The SentinelOne tenant URL.
                - **API token**: The SentinelOne API access token you generated previously, with permission to read SentinelOne data and perform actions on enrolled hosts.
            1. Click **Save**.<br /><br />
    
    1. **Create and enable a rule to generate ((elastic-sec)) alerts.** (Optional) Create a <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-create" section="create-custom-rule">custom query detection rule</DocLink> to generate ((elastic-sec)) alerts whenever SentinelOne generates alerts. 

        Use these settings when creating the custom query rule to target the data collected from SentinelOne:
        - **Index patterns**: `logs-sentinel_one.alert*`
        - **Custom query**: `observer.serial_number:*`<br /><br />

        <DocCallOut title="Note">
        Do not include any other index patterns or query parameters.
        </DocCallOut>

        This gives you visibility into SentinelOne without needing to leave ((elastic-sec)). You can perform supported endpoint response actions directly from alerts that the rule creates, by using the **Take action** menu on the alert details flyout.
