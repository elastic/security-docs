Add ((elastic-defend))'s <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/response-actions">response actions</DocLink> to detection rules to automatically perform actions on an affected host when an event meets the rule's criteria. Use these actions to support your response to detected threats and suspicious events.

<DocCallOut title="Requirements">

- Automated response actions require an [Enterprise subscription](https://www.elastic.co/pricing).
- Hosts must have ((agent)) installed with the ((elastic-defend)) integration.
- Your user role must have the ability to create detection rules and to perform <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/response-actions" section="response-action-commands">specific response actions</DocLink>.
- You can only add automated response actions to custom query rules.

</DocCallOut>

You can add automated response actions to a new or existing custom query rule.

1. Do one of the following:
   - **New rule**: On the last step of <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-create" section="create-custom-rule"> custom query rule</DocLink> creation, go to the **Response Actions** section and select **((elastic-defend))**.
   - **Existing rule**: Edit the rule's settings, then go to the **Actions** tab. In the tab, select **((elastic-defend))** under the **Response Actions** section.

1. Select an option in the **Response action** field:
   - **Isolate**: <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/isolate-host">Isolate the host</DocLink>, blocking communication with other hosts on the network.
   - **Kill process**: Terminate a process on the host.
   - **Suspend process**: Temporarily suspend a process on the host.

   <DocCallOut title="Important">
   Be aware that automatic host isolation can result in unintended consequences, such as disrupting legitimate user activities or blocking critical business processes.
   </DocCallOut>

1. For process actions, specify how to identify the process you want to terminate or suspend:
   - Turn on the toggle to use the alert's **process.pid** value as the identifier.
   - To use a different alert field value to identify the process, turn off the toggle and enter the **Custom field name**.

1. Enter a comment describing why youâ€™re performing the action on the host (optional).

1. To finish adding the response action, click **Create & enable rule** (for a new rule) or **Save changes** (for existing rules).
