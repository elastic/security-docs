[[isolate-host]]
= Isolate a host

:description: Host isolation allows you to cut off a host's network access until you release it.
:keywords: serverless, security, defend, how-to, manage

preview:[]

Host isolation allows you to isolate hosts from your network, blocking communication with other hosts on your network until you release the host. Isolating a host is useful for responding to malicious activity or preventing potential attacks, as it prevents lateral movement across other hosts.

Isolated hosts, however, can still send data to {elastic-sec}. You can also create <<host-isolation-exceptions,host isolation exceptions>> for specific IP addresses that isolated hosts are still allowed to communicate with, even when blocked from the rest of your network.

.Requirements
[NOTE]
====
* Host isolation requires the Endpoint Protection Complete https://www.elastic.co/docs/current/serverless/elasticsearch/manage-project[project feature].
* Hosts must have {agent} installed with the {elastic-defend} integration.
* Host isolation is supported for endpoints running Windows, macOS, and these Linux distributions:
+
** CentOS/RHEL 8
** Debian 11
** Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, and 22.04
** AWS Linux 2
* To isolate and release hosts running any operating system, you must have the appropriate user role.

You can isolate a host from a detection alert's details flyout, from the Endpoints page, or from the endpoint response console. Once a host is successfully isolated, an `Isolated` status displays next to the `Agent status` field, which you can view on the alert details flyout or Endpoints list table.

[TIP]
====
If the request fails, verify that the {agent} and your endpoint are both online before trying again.
====

All actions executed on a host are tracked in the host’s response actions history, which you can access from the Endpoints page. Refer to <<view-host-isolation-details,View host isolation history>> for more information.

== Isolate a host

.Isolate a host from a detection alert
[%collapsible]
=====
. Open a detection alert:

* From the Alerts table or Timeline: Click **View details** (image:images/icons/expand.svg[View details]).
* From a case with an attached alert: Click **Show alert details** (**>**).

. Click **Take action → Isolate host**.
. Enter a comment describing why you’re isolating the host (optional).
. Click **Confirm**.
=====

.Isolate a host from an endpoint
[%collapsible]
=====
. Go to **Assets → Endpoints**, then either:
+
** Select the appropriate endpoint in the **Endpoint** column, and click **Take action → Isolate host** in the endpoint details flyout.
** Click the **Actions** menu (_..._) on the appropriate endpoint, then select **Isolate host**.
. Enter a comment describing why you’re isolating the host (optional).
. Click **Confirm**.
=====

.Isolate a host from the response console
[%collapsible]
=====
[NOTE]
====
The response console requires the Endpoint Protection Complete https://www.elastic.co/docs/current/serverless/elasticsearch/manage-project[project feature].
====

. Open the response console for the host (select the **Respond** button or actions menu option on the host, endpoint, or alert details view).
. Enter the `isolate` command and an optional comment in the input area, for example:
+
`isolate --comment "Isolate this host"`
. Press **Return**.
=====

.Automatically isolate a host using a rule's endpoint response action
[%collapsible]
=====
[NOTE]
====
The host isolation endpoint response action requires the Endpoint Protection Complete https://www.elastic.co/docs/current/serverless/elasticsearch/manage-project[project feature].
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Be aware that automatic host isolation can result in unintended consequences, such as disrupting legitimate user activities or blocking critical business processes.
====

. Add an endpoint response action to a new or existing custom query rule. The endpoint response action will run whenever rule conditions are met:
+
** **New rule**: On the last step of <<create-custom-rule,custom query rule>> creation, go to the **Response Actions** section and select **{elastic-defend}**.
** **Existing rule**: Edit the rule's settings, then go to the **Actions** tab. In the tab, select **{elastic-defend}** under the **Response Actions** section.
. Click the **Response action** field, then select **Isolate**.
. Enter a comment describing why you’re isolating the host (optional).
. To finish adding the response action, click **Create & enable rule** (for a new rule) or **Save changes** (for existing rules).
=====

After the host is successfully isolated, an **Isolated** status is added to the endpoint. Active end users receive a notification that the computer has been isolated from the network:

[[release-a-host]]
== Release a host

.Release a host from a detection alert
[%collapsible]
=====
. Open a detection alert:

* From the Alerts table or Timeline: Click **View details** (image:images/icons/expand.svg[View details]).
* From a case with an attached alert: Click **Show alert details** (**>**).

. From the alert details flyout, click **Take action → Release host**.
. Enter a comment describing why you're releasing the host (optional).
. Click **Confirm**.

** Select the appropriate endpoint in the **Endpoint** column, and click **Take action → Release host** in the endpoint details flyout.
** Click the **Actions** menu (_..._) on the appropriate endpoint, then select **Release host**.
. Enter a comment describing why you're releasing the host (optional).

.Release a host from the response console

The response console requires the Endpoint Protection Complete https://www.elastic.co/docs/current/serverless/elasticsearch/manage-project[project feature].
====

. Open the response console for the host (select the **Respond** button or actions menu option on the host, endpoint, or alert details view).
. Enter the `release` command and an optional comment in the input area, for example:
+
`release --comment "Release this host"`
. Press **Return**.
=====

After the host is successfully released, the **Isolated** status is removed from the endpoint. Active end users receive a notification that the computer has been reconnected to the network:

[[view-host-isolation-details]]
== View host isolation history

To confirm if a host has been successfully isolated or released, check the response actions history, which logs the response actions performed on a host.

Go to **Assets** → **Endpoints**, click an endpoint's name, then click the **Response action history** tab. You can filter the information displayed in this view. Refer to <<response-actions-history,Response actions history>> for more details.
