preview::[]

You can perform response actions on hosts enrolled in other third-party endpoint protection systems, such as CrowdStrike or SentinelOne. For example, you can direct the other system to isolate a suspicious endpoint from your network, without leaving the {elastic-sec} UI.

.Requirements
[NOTE]
====
* Third-party response actions require the Endpoint Protection Complete <<elasticsearch-manage-project,project feature>>.
* Each response action type has its own user role privilege requirements. Find an action's role requirements at <<security-response-actions>>.
* Additional <<security-response-actions-config,configuration>> is required to connect {elastic-sec} with a third-party system.

These response actions are supported for CrowdStrike-enrolled hosts:

* **Isolate and release a host** using any of these methods:
+
** From a detection alert
** From the response console
+
Refer to the instructions on <<isolate-a-host,isolating>> and <<release-a-host,releasing>> hosts for more details.

These response actions are supported for SentinelOne-enrolled hosts:

* **Isolate and release a host** using any of these methods:
+
** From a detection alert
** From the response console
+
Refer to the instructions on <<isolate-a-host,isolating>> and <<release-a-host,releasing>> hosts for more details.
* **Retrieve a file from a host** with the <<get-file,`get-file` response action>>.
+
[NOTE]
====
For SentinelOne-enrolled hosts, you must use the password `Elastic@123` to open the retrieved file.
====
* **Get a list of processes running on a host** with the <<processes,`processes` response action>>. For SentinelOne-enrolled hosts, this command returns a link for downloading the process list in a file.
* **Terminate a process running on a host** with the <<kill-process,`kill-process` response action>>.
+
[NOTE]
====
For SentinelOne-enrolled hosts, you must use the parameter `--processName` to identify the process to terminate. `--pid` and `--entityId` are not supported.

Example: `kill-process --processName cat --comment "Terminate suspicious process"`
====
* **View past response action activity** in the <<security-response-actions-history,response actions history>> log.
