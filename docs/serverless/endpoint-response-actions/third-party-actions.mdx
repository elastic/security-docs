## SentinelOne response actions

You can direct SentinelOne to perform response actions on protected hosts without leaving the ((elastic-sec)) UI. Prior <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/response-actions-config">configuration</DocLink> is required to connect ((elastic-sec)) with SentinelOne.

The following response actions and related features are supported for SentinelOne-protected hosts:

- **Isolate and release a host** using any of these methods:
   - From a detection alert
   - From the response console

   Refer to the instructions on <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/isolate-host" section="isolate-a-host">isolating</DocLink> and <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/isolate-host" section="release-a-host">releasing</DocLink> hosts for more details.

- **View past response action activity** in the <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/response-actions-history">response actions history</DocLink> log.
