<div id="third-party-actions"></div>

You can perform response actions on hosts enrolled in other third-party endpoint protection systems, such as CrowdStrike or SentinelOne. For example, you can direct the other system to isolate a suspicious endpoint from your network, without leaving the ((elastic-sec)) UI.

<DocCallOut title="Requirements">

* Third-party response actions require the Endpoint Protection Complete <DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/manage-project" text="project feature" />.

* Each response action type has its own user role privilege requirements. Find an action's role requirements at <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/response-actions" />.

## Supported systems and response actions

The following third-party response actions are supported for CrowdStrike and SentinelOne. <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/response-actions-config">Prior configuration is required</DocLink> to connect each system with ((elastic-sec)).

<DocTabs>
   <DocTab name="CrowdStrike">
   These response actions are supported for CrowdStrike-enrolled hosts:

   - **Isolate and release a host** using any of these methods:
      - From a detection alert
      - From the response console<br /><br />

      Refer to the instructions on <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/isolate-host" section="isolate-a-host">isolating</DocLink> and <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/isolate-host" section="release-a-host">releasing</DocLink> hosts for more details.
   </DocTab>

   <DocTab name="SentinelOne">
   These response actions are supported for SentinelOne-enrolled hosts:

   - **Isolate and release a host** using any of these methods:
      - From a detection alert
      - From the response console<br /><br />

      Refer to the instructions on <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/isolate-host" section="isolate-a-host">isolating</DocLink> and <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/isolate-host" section="release-a-host">releasing</DocLink> hosts for more details.<br /><br />

   - **Retrieve a file from a host** with the <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/response-actions" section="get-file">`get-file` response action</DocLink>.
      <DocCallOut title="Note">
      For SentinelOne-enrolled hosts, you must use the password `Elastic@123` to open the retrieved file.
      </DocCallOut>

   - **Get a list of processes running on a host** with the <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/response-actions" section="processes">`processes` response action</DocLink>. For SentinelOne-enrolled hosts, this command returns a link for downloading the process list in a file.<br /><br />
   
   - **Terminate a process running on a host** with the <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/response-actions" section="kill-process">`kill-process` response action</DocLink>. 
      <DocCallOut title="Note">
      For SentinelOne-enrolled hosts, you must use the parameter `--processName` to identify the process to terminate. `--pid` and `--entityId` are not supported.

      Example: `kill-process --processName cat --comment "Terminate suspicious process"`
      </DocCallOut>

    - **View past response action activity** in the <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/response-actions-history">response actions history</DocLink> log.
