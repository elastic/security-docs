## SentinelOne response actions

You can direct SentinelOne to perform response actions on protected hosts without leaving the ((elastic-sec)) UI. Prior <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/response-actions-config">configuration</DocLink> is required to connect ((elastic-sec)) with SentinelOne.

<DocCallOut title="Requirements">

Third-party response actions require the Endpoint Protection Complete <DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/manage-project" text="project feature" />, and each response action type has its own user role privilege requirements. Refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/response-actions" /> for more information.

</DocCallOut>

The following response actions and related features are supported for SentinelOne-protected hosts:

- **Isolate and release a host** using any of these methods:
   - From a detection alert
   - From the response console

   Refer to the instructions on <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/isolate-host" section="isolate-a-host">isolating</DocLink> and <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/isolate-host" section="release-a-host">releasing</DocLink> hosts for more details.

- **Retrieve a file from a host** with the <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/response-actions" section="get-file">`get-file` response action</DocLink>.
   <DocCallOut title="Note">
   For SentinelOne-protected hosts, you must use the password `Elastic@123` to open the retrieved file.
   </DocCallOut>

- **View past response action activity** in the <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/response-actions-history">response actions history</DocLink> log.
