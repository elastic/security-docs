<div id="third-party-actions"></div>

You can perform response actions on hosts enrolled in other third-party endpoint protection systems, such as CrowdStrike or SentinelOne. For example, you can direct the other system to isolate a suspicious endpoint from your network, without leaving the ((elastic-sec)) UI.

<DocCallOut title="Requirements">

* Third-party response actions require the Endpoint Protection Complete <DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/manage-project" text="project feature" />.

* Each response action type has its own user role privilege requirements. Find an action's role requirements at <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/response-actions" />.
