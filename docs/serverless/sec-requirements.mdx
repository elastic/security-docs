<DocBadge template="technical preview" />
The [Support Matrix](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix) page lists officially
supported operating systems, platforms, and browsers on which components such as ((beats)), ((agent)), ((elastic-defend)), and ((elastic-endpoint)) have been tested.

## Feature-specific requirements

There are some additional requirements for specific features:

* <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/detections-requirements">Detections prerequisites and requirements</DocLink>
* <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/cases-requirements">Cases prerequisites</DocLink>
* <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/ers-requirements">Entity risk scoring prerequisites</DocLink>
* <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/ml-requirements">Machine learning job and rule requirements</DocLink>
* <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/elastic-endpoint-deploy-reqs">((elastic-endpoint)) requirements</DocLink>
* <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/conf-map-ui">Configure network map data</DocLink>

{/* Hiding the content below until we can validate equivalent statements for serverless. */}
{/* ## License requirements

All features are available as part of the free Basic plan **except**:

* <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-create" section="set-up-alert-notifications-optional">Alert notifications via external systems</DocLink>
* <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/machine-learning">((ml-cap)) jobs and rules</DocLink>
* <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/cases-settings">Cases integration with third-party ticketing
    systems</DocLink>

## Advanced configuration and UI options

<DocLink slug="/serverless/security/advanced-settings">Configure advanced settings</DocLink> describes how to modify advanced settings, such as the
((elastic-sec)) indices, default time intervals used in filters, and IP reputation
links. */}

## Third-party collectors mapped to ECS

The [Elastic Common Schema (ECS)](((ecs-ref))) defines a common set of fields to be used for storing event data in Elasticsearch. ECS helps users normalize their event data
to better analyze, visualize, and correlate the data represented in their
events. ((elastic-sec)) can ingest and normalize events from any ECS-compliant data source.

<DocCallOut title="Important" color="warning">
((elastic-sec)) requires [ECS-compliant data](((ecs-ref))). If you use third-party data collectors to ship data to ((es)), the data must be mapped to ECS. <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/siem-field-reference">((elastic-sec)) ECS field reference</DocLink> lists ECS fields used in ((elastic-sec)).

{/* ## Cross-cluster searches

For information on how to perform cross-cluster searches on ((elastic-sec))
indices, see:

* [Search across cluster](((ref))/modules-cross-cluster-search.html)
    (for self-managed ((stack)) deployments)

* [Enable cross-cluster search](((cloud))/ec-enable-ccs.html) (for hosted deployments) */}
