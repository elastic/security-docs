To use the <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/detection-engine-overview">Detections feature</DocLink>, you first need to
configure a few settings. You also need the appropriate role to send
<DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-create" section="set-up-alert-notifications-optional">notifications</DocLink> when detection alerts are generated.

Additionally, there are some <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/detections-requirements" section="configure-list-upload-limits">advanced settings</DocLink> used to
configure <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/value-lists-exceptions">value list</DocLink> upload limits.

## Enable and access detections

{/* TO-DO: Remove the DocIf conditionals once the feature is available in production. */}

<DocIf condition={"((serverlessCustomRoles))" === "false"}>
To use the Detections feature, it must be enabled and you must have the appropriate <DocLink slug="/serverless/general/assign-user-roles">predefined Security user role</DocLink> to access rules and alerts. If your role doesn't have the privileges needed to enable this feature, you can request someone who has these privileges to visit your ((kib)) space, which will turn it on for you.

<DocCallOut title="Note">
For instructions about using ((ml)) jobs and rules, refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/ml-requirements">Machine learning job and rule requirements</DocLink>.
</DocCallOut>
</DocIf>

<DocIf condition={"((serverlessCustomRoles))" === "true"}>
To use the Detections feature, it must be enabled and you must have either the appropriate <DocLink slug="/serverless/general/assign-user-roles">predefined Security user role</DocLink> or a <DocLink slug="/serverless/custom-roles">custom role</DocLink> with privileges to access rules and alerts. If your role doesn't have the privileges needed to enable this feature, you can request someone who has these privileges to visit your ((kib)) space, which will turn it on for you.

### Custom role privileges

The following table describes the required custom role privileges to access the Detections feature, including rules and alerts. For more information on ((kib)) privileges, refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/custom-roles" />.

            `All` for the `Security` feature

            **NOTE:** You need additional `Action and Connectors` feature privileges (**Management → Action and Connectors**) to manage rules with actions and connectors:

            * To provide full access to rule actions and connectors, give your role `All` privileges. With `Read` privileges, you can edit rule actions, but will have limited capabilities to manage connectors. For example, `Read` privileges allow you to add or remove an existing connector from a rule, but does not allow you to create a new connector.

            * To import rules with actions, you need at least `Read` privileges for the `Action and Connectors` feature. To overwrite or add new connectors, you need `All` privileges for the `Actions and Connectors` feature. To import rules without actions,  you don't need `Actions and Connectors` privileges.

### Authorization

Rules, including all background detection and the actions they generate, are authorized using an [API key](((kibana-ref))/api-keys.html) associated with the last user to edit the rule. Upon creating or modifying a rule, an API key is generated for that user, capturing a snapshot of their privileges. The API key is then used to run all background tasks associated with the rule including detection checks and executing actions.

<DocCallOut title="Important" color="warning">

If a rule requires certain privileges to run, such as index privileges, keep in mind that if a user without those privileges updates the rule, the rule will no longer function.
