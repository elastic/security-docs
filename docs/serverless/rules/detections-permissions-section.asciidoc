To use the <<security-detection-engine-overview,Detections feature>>, you first need to
configure a few settings. You also need the appropriate role to send
<<security-rules-create,notifications>> when detection alerts are generated.

Additionally, there are some <<security-detections-requirements,advanced settings>> used to
configure <<security-value-lists-exceptions,value list>> upload limits.

[[enable-detections-ui]]
== Enable and access detections

To use the Detections feature, it must be enabled and you must have either the appropriate <<general-assign-user-roles,predefined Security user role>> or a <<custom-roles,custom role>> with privileges to access rules and alerts. If your role doesn't have the privileges needed to enable this feature, you can request someone who has these privileges to visit your {kib} space, which will turn it on for you.

[NOTE]
====
For instructions about using {ml} jobs and rules, refer to <<security-ml-requirements,Machine learning job and rule requirements>>.

[[security-detections-requirements-custom-role-privileges]]
=== Custom role privileges

The following table describes the required custom role privileges to access the Detections feature, including rules and alerts. For more information on {kib} privileges, refer to <<custom-roles>>.

|===
| Action | Cluster Privilege | Index Privileges | {kib} Privileges

| Enable detections in your space
| `manage`
a| `manage`, `write`, `read`, and `view_index_metadata` for these system indices and data streams, where `<space-id>` is the space name:

* `.alerts-security.alerts-<space-id>`
* `.lists-<space-id>`
* `.items-<space-id>`
| `All` for the `Security` feature

a| Enable detections in all spaces

**NOTE:** To turn on detections, visit the Rules and Alerts pages for each space.
| `manage`
a| `manage`, `write`, `read`, and `view_index_metadata` for these system indices and data streams:

* `.alerts-security.alerts-<space-id>`
* `.lists-<space-id>`
* `.items-<space-id>`
| `All` for the `Security` feature

| Preview rules
| N/A
a| `read` for these indices:

* `.preview.alerts-security.alerts-<space-id>`
* `.internal.preview.alerts-security.alerts-<space-id>-*`
| `All` for the `Security` feature

| Manage rules
| N/A
a| `manage`, `write`, `read`, and `view_index_metadata` for these system indices and data streams, where `<space-id>` is the space name:

* `.alerts-security.alerts-<space-id`
* `.lists-<space-id>`
* `.items-<space-id>`
a| `All` for the `Security` feature

**NOTE:** You need additional `Action and Connectors` feature privileges (**Management â†’ Action and Connectors**) to manage rules with actions and connectors:

* To provide full access to rule actions and connectors, give your role `All` privileges. With `Read` privileges, you can edit rule actions, but will have limited capabilities to manage connectors. For example, `Read` privileges allow you to add or remove an existing connector from a rule, but does not allow you to create a new connector.
* To import rules with actions, you need at least `Read` privileges for the `Action and Connectors` feature. To overwrite or add new connectors, you need `All` privileges for the `Actions and Connectors` feature. To import rules without actions,  you don't need `Actions and Connectors` privileges.

a| Manage alerts

**NOTE**: Allows you to manage alerts, but not modify rules.
| N/A
a| `maintenance`, `write`, `read`, and `view_index_metadata` for these system indices and data streams, where `<space-id>` is the space name:

* `.alerts-security.alerts-<space-id>`
* `.internal.alerts-security.alerts-<space-id>-*`
* `.lists-<space-id>`
* `.items-<space-id>`
| `Read` for the `Security` feature

a| Create the `.lists` and `.items` data streams in your space

**NOTE**: To initiate the process that creates the data streams, you must visit the Rules page for each appropriate space.
| `manage`
a| `manage`, `write`, `read`, and `view_index_metadata` for these data streams, where `<space-id>` is the space name:

* `.lists-<space-id>`
* `.items-<space-id>`
| `All` for the `Security` and `Saved Objects Management` features

[[alerting-auth-model]]
=== Authorization

Rules, including all background detection and the actions they generate, are authorized using an {kibana-ref}/api-keys.html[API key] associated with the last user to edit the rule. Upon creating or modifying a rule, an API key is generated for that user, capturing a snapshot of their privileges. The API key is then used to run all background tasks associated with the rule including detection checks and executing actions.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If a rule requires certain privileges to run, such as index privileges, keep in mind that if a user without those privileges updates the rule, the rule will no longer function.
