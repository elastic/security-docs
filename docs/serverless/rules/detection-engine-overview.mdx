Use the detection engine to create and manage rules and view the alerts
these rules create. Rules periodically search indices (such as `logs-*` and
`filebeat-*`) for suspicious source events and create alerts when a rule's
conditions are met. When an alert is created, its status is `Open`. To help
track investigations, an alert's <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/alerts-manage" section="change-an-alerts-status">status</DocLink> can be set as 
`Open`, `Acknowledged`, or `Closed`.

In addition to creating <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-create">your own rules</DocLink>, enable
<DocLink slug="/serverless/security/prebuilt-rules-management" section="install-and-enable-elastic-prebuilt-rules">Elastic prebuilt rules</DocLink> to immediately start detecting
suspicious activity. For detailed information on all the prebuilt rules, see the <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/prebuilt-rules">Prebuilt rules reference</DocLink>. Once the prebuilt rules are loaded and
running, <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/tune-detection-signals">Tune detection rules</DocLink> and <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/add-exceptions">Add and manage exceptions</DocLink> explain
how to modify the rules to reduce false positives and get a better set of
actionable alerts. You can also use exceptions and value lists when creating or
modifying your own rules.

There are two special prebuilt rules you need to know about:

{/* Links to prebuilt rule pages temporarily removed for initial serverless docs. */}
* **Endpoint Security**:
    Automatically creates an alert from all incoming Elastic Endpoint alerts. To
    receive Elastic Endpoint alerts, you must install the Endpoint agent on your
    hosts (see <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/install-edr">Install and configure the ((elastic-defend)) integration</DocLink>).

    When this rule is enabled, the following Endpoint events are displayed as
    detection alerts:

        * Malware Prevention Alert
        * Malware Detection Alert

    <DocCallOut title="Note">
    When you load the prebuilt rules, this is the only rule that is enabled
    by default.
    </DocCallOut>

{/* Links to prebuilt rule pages temporarily removed for initial serverless docs. */}
* **External Alerts**: Automatically creates an alert for
    all incoming third-party system alerts (for example, Suricata alerts).

If you want to receive notifications via external systems, such as Slack or
email, when alerts are created, use the [Alerting and Actions](((kibana-ref))/alerting-getting-started.html) framework.

After rules have started running, you can monitor their executions to verify
they are functioning correctly, as well as view, manage, and troubleshoot
alerts (see <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/alerts-manage">Manage detection alerts</DocLink> and <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/alerts-ui-monitor">Monitor and troubleshoot rule executions</DocLink>).

You can create and manage rules and alerts via the UI or the [Detections API](((security-guide))/rule-api-overview.html).
{/* Link to classic docs until serverless API docs are available. */}

## Limited support for indicator match rules

Indicator match rules provide a powerful capability to search your security data; however, their queries can consume significant deployment resources. When creating an <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-create" section="create-an-indicator-match-rule">indicator match rule</DocLink>, we recommend limiting the time range of the indicator index query to the minimum period necessary for the desired rule coverage. For example, the default indicator index query `@timestamp > "now-30d/d"` searches specified indicator indices for indicators ingested during the past 30 days and rounds the query start time down to the nearest day (resolves to UTC `00:00:00`). Without this limitation, the rule will include all of the indicators in your indicator indices, which may extend the time it takes for the indicator index query to complete.

In addition, indicator match rules with an additional look-back time value greater than 24 hours are not supported.

## Detections configuration and prerequisites

<DocLink slug="/serverless/security/detections-requirements">Detections requirements</DocLink> provides detailed information on all the
permissions required to initiate and use the Detections feature.

<div id="malware-prevention"></div>

## Malware prevention

Malware, short for malicious software, is any software program designed to damage or execute unauthorized actions on a
computer system. Examples of malware include viruses, worms, Trojan horses, adware, scareware, and spyware. Some
malware, such as viruses, can severely damage a computer's hard drive by deleting files or directory information. Other
malware, such as spyware, can obtain user data without their knowledge.

Malware may be stealthy and appear as legitimate executable code, scripts, active content, and other software. It is also
often embedded in non-malicious files, non-suspicious websites, and standard programs — sometimes making the root
source difficult to identify. If infected and not resolved promptly, malware can cause irreparable damage to a computer
network.

For information on how to enable malware protection on your host, see <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/configure-endpoint-integration-policy" section="malware-protection">Malware Protection</DocLink>.

<div id="machine-learning-model"></div>

### Machine learning model

To determine if a file is malicious or benign, a machine learning model looks for static attributes of files (without executing
the file) that include file structure, layout, and content. This includes information such as file header data, imports, exports,
section names, and file size. These attributes are extracted from millions of benign and malicious file samples, which then
are passed to a machine-learning algorithm that distinguishes a benign file from a malicious one. The machine learning
model is updated as new data is procured and analyzed.

### Threshold

A malware threshold determines the action the agent should take if malware is detected. The Elastic Agent uses a recommended threshold level that generates a balanced number of alerts with a low probability of undetected malware. This threshold also minimizes the number of false positive alerts.

<div id="ransomware-prevention"></div>

## Ransomware prevention

Ransomware is computer malware that installs discreetly on a user's computer and encrypts data until a specified amount of money (ransom) is paid. Ransomware is usually similar to other malware in its delivery and execution, infecting systems
through spear-phishing or drive-by downloads. If not resolved immediately, ransomware can cause irreparable damage to an entire computer network.

Behavioral ransomware prevention on the Elastic Endpoint detects and stops ransomware attacks on Windows systems by analyzing data from low-level system processes, and is effective across an array of widespread ransomware families — including those targeting the system’s master boot record.

For information on how to enable ransomware protection on your host, see <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/configure-endpoint-integration-policy" section="ransomware-protection">Ransomware protection</DocLink>.

### Resolve UI error messages

Depending on your user role privileges and whether detection system indices have already been created, you might get one of these error messages when you 
open the **Alerts** or **Rules** page:

* **`Let’s set up your detection engine`**

    If you get this message, a user with specific privileges must visit the
    **Alerts** or **Rules** page before you can view detection alerts and rules.
    Refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/detections-requirements" section="enable-and-access-detections">Enable and access detections</DocLink> for a list of all the requirements.

* **`Detection engine permissions required`**

    If you get this message, you do not have the
    <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/detection-engine-overview" section="detections-permissions">required privileges</DocLink> to view the **Detections** feature,
    and you should contact your project administrator.
