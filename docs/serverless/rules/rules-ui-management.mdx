The Rules page allows you to view and manage all prebuilt and custom detection rules.

![The Rules page](../images/rules-ui-management/-detections-all-rules.png)

On the Rules page, you can:

* <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-ui-management" section="sort-and-filter-the-rules-list">Sort and filter the rules list</DocLink>
* <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-ui-management" section="check-the-current-status-of-rules">Check the current status of rules</DocLink>
* <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-ui-management" section="modify-existing-rules-settings">Modify existing rules settings</DocLink>
* <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-ui-management" section="manage-rules">Manage rules</DocLink>

* <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/alerts-ui-monitor" section="troubleshoot-missing-alerts">Troubleshoot missing alerts</DocLink>

<div id="sort-filter-rules"></div>

## Sort and filter the rules list

To sort the rules list, click any column header. To sort in descending order, click the column header again.

To filter the rules list, enter a search term in the search bar and press **Return**:

* Rule name — Enter a word or phrase from a rule's name.
* Index pattern — Enter an index pattern (such as `filebeat-*`) to display all rules that use it. 
* MITRE ATT&CK tactic or technique — Enter a MITRE ATT&CK tactic name (such as `Defense Evasion`) or technique number (such as `TA0005`) to display all associated rules.

<DocCallOut title="Note">
Searches for index patterns and MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques must match exactly, are case sensitive, and do _not_ support wildcards. For example, to find rules using the `filebeat-*` index pattern, the search term `filebeat-*` is valid, but `filebeat` and `file*` are not because they don't exactly match the index pattern. Likewise, the MITRE ATT&CK tactic `Defense Evasion` is valid, but `Defense`, `defense evasion`, and `Defense*` are not.
</DocCallOut>

You can also filter the rules list by selecting the **Tags**, **Last response**, **Elastic rules**, **Custom rules**, **Enabled rules**, and **Disabled rules** filters next to the search bar.

The rules list retains your sorting and filtering settings when you navigate away and return to the page. These settings are also preserved when you copy the page's URL and paste into another browser. Select **Clear filters** above the table to revert to the default view.

<div id="rule-status"></div>

## Check the current status of rules

The **Last response** column displays the current status of each rule, based on the most recent attempt to run the rule:

* **Succeeded**: The rule completed its defined search. This doesn't necessarily mean it generated an alert, just that it ran without error.
* **Failed**: The rule encountered an error that prevented it from running. For example, a ((ml)) rule whose corresponding ((ml)) job wasn't running.
* **Warning**: Nothing prevented the rule from running, but it might have returned unexpected results. For example, a custom query rule tried to search an index pattern that couldn't be found in ((es)).

For ((ml)) rules, an indicator icon (<DocIcon type="alert" title="Error" size="s"/>) also appears in this column if a required ((ml)) job isn't running. Click the icon to list the affected jobs, then click **Visit rule details page to investigate** to open the rule's details page, where you can start the ((ml)) job.

<div id="edit-rules-settings"></div>

## Modify existing rules settings

You can edit an existing rule's settings, and can bulk edit settings for multiple rules at once.

<DocCallOut title="Note">

For prebuilt Elastic rules, you can't modify most settings. You can only edit <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-create" section="set-the-rules-schedule">rule actions</DocLink> and <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/add-exceptions">add exceptions</DocLink>. If you try to bulk edit with both prebuilt and custom rules selected, the action will affect only the rules that can be modified.

Similarly, rules will be skipped if they can't be modified by a bulk edit. For example, if you try to apply a tag to rules that already have that tag, or apply an index pattern to rules that use data views.

</DocCallOut>

1. Go to **Rules** → **Detection rules (SIEM)**.
1. Do one of the following:
   * **Edit a single rule**: Select the **All actions** menu (<DocIcon type="boxesHorizontal" title="Actions menu" size="m" />) on a rule, then select **Edit rule settings**. The **Edit rule settings** view opens, where you can modify the <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-create">rule's settings</DocLink>.
   * **Bulk edit multiple rules**: Select the rules you want to edit, then select an action from the **Bulk actions** menu:
       * **Index patterns**: Add or delete the index patterns used by all selected rules.
       * **Tags**: Add or delete tags on all selected rules.
       * **Add rule actions**: Add <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-create" section="set-up-alert-notifications-optional">rule actions</DocLink> on all selected rules. If you add multiple actions, you can specify an action frequency for each of them. To overwrite the frequency of existing actions select the option to **Overwrite all selected rules actions**.

          <DocCallOut title="Note">
          Rule actions won't run during a [maintenance window](((kibana-ref))/maintenance-windows.html). They'll resume running after the maintenance window ends.
          </DocCallOut>

    * **Update rule schedules**: Update the <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-create" section="set-the-rules-schedule">schedules</DocLink> and look-back times on all selected rules.
    * **Apply Timeline template**: Apply a specified <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/timeline-templates-ui">Timeline template</DocLink> to the selected rules. You can also choose **None** to remove Timeline templates from the selected rules.
1. On the page or flyout that opens, update the rule settings and actions. 

   <DocCallOut title="Tip">
   To <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-ui-management" section="snooze-rule-actions">snooze</DocLink> rule actions, go to the **Actions** tab and click the bell icon.
   </DocCallOut>

1. If available, select **Overwrite all selected _x_** to overwrite the settings on the rules. For example, if you're adding tags to multiple rules, selecting **Overwrite all selected rules tags** removes all the rules' original tags and replaces them with the tags you specify.
1. Click **Save**.

<div id="manage-rules-ui"></div>

## Manage rules

You can duplicate, enable, disable, delete, and snooze actions for rules:

<DocCallOut title="Note">
When duplicating a rule with exceptions, you can choose to duplicate the rule and its exceptions (active and expired), the rule and active exceptions only, or only the rule. If you duplicate the rule and its exceptions, copies of the exceptions are created and added to the duplicated rule's <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rule-exceptions">default rule list</DocLink>. If the original rule used exceptions from a shared exception list, the duplicated rule will reference the same shared exception list.  
</DocCallOut>

1. Go to **Rules** → **Detection rules (SIEM)**.
1. Do one of the following:
    * Select the **All actions** menu (<DocIcon type="boxesHorizontal" title="Actions menu" size="m" />) on a rule, then select an action.
    * Select all the rules you want to modify, then select an action from the **Bulk actions** menu.
    * To enable or disable a single rule, switch on the rule's **Enabled** toggle.
    * To <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/rules-ui-management" section="snooze-rule-actions">snooze</DocLink> actions for rules, click the bell icon.

<div id="snooze-rule-actions"></div>

## Snooze rule actions

Instead of turning rules off to stop alert notifications, you can snooze rule actions for a specified time period. When you snooze rule actions, the rule continues to run on its defined schedule, but won't perform any actions or send alert notifications. 

You can snooze notifications temporarily or indefinitely. When actions are snoozed, you can cancel or change the duration of the snoozed state. You can also schedule and manage recurring downtime for actions.

You can snooze rule notifications from the **Installed Rules** tab, the rule details page, or the **Actions** tab when editing a rule.

<div id="import-export-rules-ui"></div>

## Export and import rules

You can export custom detection rules to an `.ndjson` file, which you can then import into another ((elastic-sec)) environment. 

<DocCallOut title="Note">

You cannot export Elastic prebuilt rules, but you can duplicate a prebuilt rule, then export the duplicated rule.

If you try to export with both prebuilt and custom rules selected, only the custom rules are exported.

</DocCallOut>

The `.ndjson` file also includes any actions, connectors, and exception lists related to the exported rules. However, other configuration items require additional handling when exporting and importing rules:

- **Data views**: For rules that use a ((kib)) data view as a data source, the exported file contains the associated `data_view_id`, but does _not_ include any other data view configuration. To export/import between ((kib)) spaces, first use the [Saved Objects](((kibana-ref))/managing-saved-objects.html#managing-saved-objects-share-to-space) UI (**Project settings** → **Content** → **Saved Objects**) to share the data view with the destination space.

To import into a different ((stack)) deployment, the destination cluster must include a data view with a matching data view ID (configured in the [data view's advanced settings](((kibana-ref))/data-views.html)). Alternatively, after importing, you can manually reconfigure the rule to use an appropriate data view in the destination system.

- **Actions and connectors**: Rule actions and connectors are included in the exported file, but sensitive information about the connector (such as authentication credentials) _is not_ included. You must re-add missing connector details after importing detection rules.

   <DocCallOut title="Tip">
   You can also use the [Saved Objects](((kibana-ref))/managing-saved-objects.html#managing-saved-objects-share-to-space) UI (**Project settings** → **Content** → **Saved Objects**) to export and import necessary connectors before importing detection rules.
   </DocCallOut>

- **Value lists**: Any value lists used for rule exceptions are _not_ included in rule exports or imports. Use the <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/value-lists-exceptions" section="manage-value-lists">Manage value lists</DocLink> UI (**Rules** → **Detection rules (SIEM)** → **Manage value lists**) to export and import value lists separately.

To export and import detection rules:

1. Go to **Rules** → **Detection rules (SIEM)**.
1. To export rules:
    1. In the rules table, select the rules you want to export.
    1. Select **Bulk actions** → **Export**, then save the exported file.
1. To import rules:

   <DocCallOut title="Note">
   To import rules with and without actions, and to manage rule connectors, you must have the appropriate user role. Refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/detections-requirements" section="enable-and-access-detections">Enable and access detections</DocLink> for more information.
   </DocCallOut>

    1. Click **Import rules**.
    1. Drag and drop the file that contains the detection rules.

        <DocCallOut title="Note">
        Imported rules must be in an `.ndjson` file.
        </DocCallOut>

    1. (Optional) Select **Overwrite existing detection rules with conflicting "rule_id"** to update existing rules if they match the `rule_id` value of any rules in the import file. Configuration data included with the rules, such as actions, is also overwritten.
    1. (Optional) Select **Overwrite existing exception lists with conflicting "list_id"** to replace existing exception lists with exception lists from the import file if they have a matching `list_id` value.
    1. (Optional) Select **Overwrite existing connectors with conflicting action "id"** to update existing connectors if they match the `action id` value of any rule actions in the import file. Configuration data included with the actions is also overwritten.
    1. Click **Import rule**.
    1. (Optional) If a connector is missing sensitive information after the import, a warning displays and you're prompted to fix the connector. In the warning, click **Go to connector**. On the Connectors page, find the connector that needs to be updated, click **Fix**, then add the necessary details.

## Confirm rule prerequisites

Many detection rules are designed to work with specific [Elastic integrations](((integrations-docs))) and data fields. These prerequisites are identified in **Related integrations** and **Required fields** on a rule's details page (**Rules** → **Detection rules (SIEM)**, then click a rule's name). **Related integrations** also displays each integration's installation status and includes links for installing and configuring the listed integrations. 

Additionally, the **Setup guide** section provides guidance on setting up the rule's requirements.

![Rule details page with Related integrations, Required fields, and Setup guide highlighted](../images/prebuilt-rules-management/-detections-rule-details-prerequisites.png)

You can also check rules' related integrations in the **Installed Rules** and **Rule Monitoring** tables. Click the **integrations** badge to display the related integrations in a popup.

<DocImage size="xl" url="../images/prebuilt-rules-management/-detections-rules-table-related-integrations.png" alt="Rules table with related integrations popup" />

<DocCallOut title="Tip">
You can hide the **integrations** badge in the rules tables by turning off the `securitySolution:showRelatedIntegrations` advanced setting.
