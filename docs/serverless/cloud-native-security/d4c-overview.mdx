Elastic Cloud Workload Protection (CWP) for Kubernetes provides cloud-native runtime protections for containerized environments by identifying and optionally blocking unexpected system behavior in Kubernetes containers.

<div id="d4c-use-cases"></div>

## Use cases

### Threat detection & threat hunting
CWP for Kubernetes sends system events from your containers to ((es)). ((elastic-sec))'s prebuilt security rules include many designed to detect malicious behavior in container runtimes. These can help you detect events that should never occur in containers, such as reverse shell executions, privilege escalation, container escape attempts, and more.

### Drift detection & prevention
Cloud-native containers should be immutable, meaning that their file systems should not change during normal operations. By leveraging this principle, security teams can detect unusual system behavior with a high degree of accuracy — without relying on more resource-intensive techniques like memory scanning or attack signature detection. Elastic’s Drift Detection mechanism has a low rate of false positives, so you can deploy it in most environments without worrying about creating excessive alerts.

### Workload protection policies
CWP for Kubernetes uses a flexible policy language to restrict container workloads to a set of allowlisted capabilities chosen by you. When employed with Drift and Threat Detection, this can provide multiple layers of defense.

| Mount point awareness | ✓ | ✓ |

## How CWP for Kubernetes works
CWP for Kubernetes uses a lightweight integration, Defend for Containers (D4C). When you set up the D4C integration, it gets deployed by ((agent)). Specifically, the ((agent)) is installed as a DaemonSet on your Kubernetes clusters, where it enables D4C to use eBPF Linux Security Modules ([LSM](https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/prog_lsm.html)) and tracepoint probes to record system events. Events are evaluated against LSM hook points, enabling ((agent)) to evaluate system activity against your policy before allowing it to proceed.

Your D4C integration policy determines which system behaviors (for example, process execution or file creation or deletion) will result in which actions. _Selectors_ and _responses_ define each policy. Selectors define the conditions which cause the associated responses to run. Responses are associated with one or more selectors, and specify one or more actions (such as `log`, `alert`, or `block`) that will occur when the conditions defined in an associated selector are met.

The default D4C policy sends data about all running processes to your ((es)) cluster. This data is used by ((elastic-sec))'s prebuilt detection rules to detect malicious behavior in container workloads.
