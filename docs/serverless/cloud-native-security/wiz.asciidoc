= Ingest Wiz data

In order to enrich your {elastic-sec} workflows with third-party cloud security posture and vulnerability data collected by Wiz:

* Follow the steps to {integrations-docs}/wiz[set up the Wiz integration]. 

* Make sure the integration version is at least 2.0.1. 

* Ensure you have `read` privileges for the following indices: `security_solution-*.misconfiguration_latest`, `security_solution-*.vulnerability_latest`.

* While configuring the Wiz integration, turn on **Cloud Configuration Finding logs** and **Vulnerability logs**. We recommend you also set the **Initial Interval** values for both settings to `2160h` (equivalent to 90 days) to ingest existing logs.

After you've completed these steps, Wiz data will appear on the **<<security-cspm-findings-page, **Misconfiguations**>> and <<security-vuln-management-findings, **Vulnerabilities**>> tabs of the **Findings** page.

Any available findings data will also appear in the entity details flyouts for related <<insights-section, alerts>>. If alerts are present for a user or host that has findings data from Wiz, the findings will appear on the <<security-users-page-user-details-flyout,users>>, and <<security-hosts-overview-host-details-flyout,hosts>> flyouts.
