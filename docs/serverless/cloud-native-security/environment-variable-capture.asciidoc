You can configure an {agent} policy to capture up to five environment variables (`env vars`).

[NOTE]
====
* Env var names must be no more than 63 characters, and env var values must be no more than 1023 characters. Values outside these limits are silently ignored.
* Env var names are case sensitive.
====

To set up environment variable capture for an {agent} policy:

. Find **Policies** in the navigation menu or use the global search field.
. Select an {agent} policy.
. Click **Show advanced settings**.
. Scroll down or search for `linux.advanced.capture_env_vars`, or `mac.advanced.capture_env_vars`.
. Enter the names of env vars you want to capture, separated by commas. For example: `PATH,USER`
. Click **Save**.

== Find captured environment variables

Captured environment variables are associated with process events, and appear in each event's `process.env_vars` field.

To view environment variables in the **Events** table:

. Click the **Events** tab on the **Hosts**, **Network**, or **Users** pages, then click **Fields** in the Events table.
. Search for the `process.env_vars` field, select it, and click **Close**.
A new column appears containing captured environment variable data.
