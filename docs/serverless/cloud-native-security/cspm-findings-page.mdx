The **Misconfigurations** tab on the Findings page displays the configuration risks identified by the <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/cspm">CSPM</DocLink> and <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/kspm">KSPM</DocLink> integrations.

## What are CSPM and KSPM findings?

CSPM and KSPM findings indicate whether a given resource passed or failed evaluation against a specific security guideline. Each finding includes metadata about the resource evaluated and the security guideline used to evaluate it. Each finding's result (`pass` or `fail`) indicates whether a particular part of your infrastructure meets a security guideline.

## Group and filter findings
By default, the Findings page lists all findings, without grouping or filtering.

### Group findings 

Click **Group findings by** to group your data by a field. Select one of the suggested fields or **Custom field** to choose your own. You can select up to three group fields at once.

* When grouping is turned on, click a group to expand it and examine all sub-groups or findings within that group.
* To turn off grouping, click **Group findings by** and select **None**.

<DocCallOut title="Note">
Multiple groupings apply to your data in the order you selected them. For example, if you first select **Cloud account**, then select **Resource**, the top-level grouping will be based on **Cloud account**, and its subordinate grouping will be based on **Resource**. 
</DocCallOut>

<div id="cspm-findings-page-filter-findings"></div>

### Filter findings
You can filter findings data in two ways:

* **KQL search bar**: For example, search for `result.evaluation : failed` to view all failed findings.
* **In-table value filters**: Hover over a finding to display available inline actions. Use the **Filter In** (plus) and **Filter Out** (minus) buttons.

## Customize the Findings table
You can use the toolbar buttons in the upper-left of the Findings table to select which columns appear:

* **Columns**: Select the left-to-right order in which columns appear.
* **Sort fields**: Sort the table by one or more columns, or turn sorting off.
* **Fields**: Select which fields to display for each finding. Selected fields appear in the table and the **Columns** menu.

<DocCallOut title="Tip">
You can also click a column's name to open a menu that allows you to perform multiple actions on the column.

## Remediate failed findings
To remediate failed findings and reduce your attack surface:

1. First, <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/cspm-findings-page" section="filter-findings">filter for failed findings</DocLink>.
1. Click the arrow to the left of a failed finding to open the findings flyout.
1. Follow the steps under **Remediation**.

    <DocCallOut title="Note">
    Remediation steps typically include commands for you to execute. These sometimes contain placeholder values that you must replace before execution.

## Generate alerts for failed Findings
You can create detection rules that detect specific failed findings directly from the Findings page.

1. Click the arrow to the left of a Finding to open the findings flyout.
1. Click **Take action**, then **Create a detection rule**. This automatically creates a detection rule that creates alerts when the associated benchmark rule generates a failed finding.
1. To review or customize the new rule, click **View rule**.
