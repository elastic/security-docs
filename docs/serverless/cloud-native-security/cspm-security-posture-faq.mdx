## CSPM FAQ
Frequently asked questions about the Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) integration and features.

**How often is my cloud security posture evaluated?**

Cloud accounts are evaluated when you first deploy the CSPM integration and every 24 hours afterward.

**Can I onboard multiple accounts at one time?**

Yes. Follow the onboarding instructions in the getting started guides for AWS, GCP, or Azure.

**When do newly enrolled cloud accounts appear on the dashboard?**

After you deploy the CSPM integration, it can take up to 10 minutes for resource fetching, evaluation, and data processing before a newly enrolled account appears on the Cloud Security Posture dashboard.

**When do unenrolled cloud accounts disappear from the dashboard?**

Newly unenrolled cloud accounts can take a maximum of 24 hours to disappear from the Cloud Security Posture dashboard.

## KSPM FAQ
Frequently asked questions about the Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) integration and features.

**What versions of Kubernetes are supported?**

For self-managed/vanilla clusters, Kubernetes version 1.23 is supported.

For EKS clusters, all Kubernetes versions available at the time of cluster deployment are supported.

**Do benchmark rules support multiple Kubernetes deployment types?**
Yes. There are different sets of benchmark rules for self-managed and third party-managed deployments. Refer to <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityGetStartedWithKspm">Get started with KSPM</DocLink> for more information about setting up each deployment type.

**Can I evaluate the security posture of my Amazon EKS clusters?**
Yes. KSPM currently supports the security posture evaluation of Amazon EKS and unmanaged Kubernetes clusters.

**How often is my cluster’s security posture evaluated?**
Clusters are evaluated when you deploy a KSPM integration, and every four hours after that.

**When do newly-enrolled clusters appear on the dashboard?**
It can take up to 10 minutes for deployment, resource fetching, evaluation, and data processing to complete before a newly-enrolled cluster appears on the dashboard.

**When do unenrolled clusters disappear from the dashboard?**
A cluster will disappear as soon as the KSPM integration fetches data while that cluster is not enrolled. The fetch process repeats every four hours, which means a newly unenrolled cluster can take a maximum of four hours to disappear from the dashboard.

## Findings page

**Are all the findings page current?**
Yes. Only the most recent findings appear on the Findings page.

**Can I build custom visualizations and dashboards that incorporate findings data?**
Yes, you can use custom visualization capabilities with findings data. To learn more, refer to [Dashboards and visualizations](((kibana-ref))/dashboard.html).

**Where is Findings data saved?**
You can access findings data using the following index patterns:

* **Current findings:** `logs-cloud_security_posture.findings_latest-*`
* **Historical findings:** `logs-cloud_security_posture.findings-*`

## Benchmark rules

**How often are my resources evaluated against benchmark rules?**
Resources are fetched and evaluated against benchmark rules when a security posture management integration is deployed. After that, the CSPM integration evaluates every 24 hours, and the KSPM integration evaluates every four hours.

**Can I configure an integration's fetch cycle?**
No, the four-hour fetch cycle is not configurable.

**Can I contribute to the CSP ruleset?**
You can't directly edit benchmark rules. The rules are defined [in this repository](https://github.com/elastic/csp-security-policies), where you can raise issues with certain rules. They are written in [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/).

**How can I tell which specific version of the CIS benchmarks is in use?**
Refer to the `rule.benchmark.name` and `rule.benchmark.version` fields for documents in these datastreams:

* `logs-cloud_security_posture.findings-default`
* `logs-cloud_security_posture.findings_latest-default`
