[[cases-ui-open]]
== Open a new case

Open a new case to keep track of security issues and share their details with
colleagues.

. Go to **Cases**, then click **Create case**. If no cases exist, the Cases table will be empty and you'll be prompted to create one by clicking the **Create case** button inside the table.
. (Optional) If you defined <<security-cases-settings-templates,templates>>, select one to use its default field values. . Give the case a name, assign a severity level, and provide a description. You can use
https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet[Markdown] syntax in the case description.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you do not assign your case a severity level, it will be assigned **Low** by default.
====
+
[TIP]
====
You can insert a Timeline link in the case description by clicking the Timeline icon (image:images/icons/timeline.svg[Timeline]).
====
. Optionally, add a category, assignees and relevant tags. You can add users only if they meet the necessary <<security-cases-requirements,prerequisites>>.
. If you defined <<security-cases-settings-custom-fields,custom fields>>, they appear in the **Additional fields** section.
. Choose if you want alert statuses to sync with the case's status after they are added to the case. This option is enabled by default, but you can turn it off after creating the case.
. From **External incident management**, select a <<security-cases-settings,connector>>. If you've previously added one, that connector displays as the default selection. Otherwise, the default setting is `No connector selected`.
. Click **Create case**.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you've selected a connector for the case, the case is automatically pushed to the third-party system it's connected to.

This functionality does not exist yet in serverless.
To be updated: references to Kibana, ESS. Once this section is added back in, edit the frontmatter description back to: Create a case in {elastic-sec}, configure email notifications, and add files and visualizations.

## Add email notifications

You can configure email notifications that occur when users are assigned to cases.

For hosted {kib} on {ess}:

1. Add the email addresses to the monitoring email allowlist. Follow the steps in
  [Send alerts by email]({cloud}/ec-watcher.html#ec-watcher-allowlist).

  You do not need to take any more steps to configure an email connector or update
  {kib} user settings, since the preconfigured Elastic-Cloud-SMTP connector is
  used by default.

For self-managed {kib}:

1. Create a preconfigured email connector.

  <DocCallOut title="Note">
  At this time, email notifications support only [preconfigured email connectors]({kibana-ref}/pre-configured-connectors.html),
  which are defined in the `kibana.yml` file.
  </DocCallOut>

1. Set the `notifications.connectors.default.email` {kib} setting to the name of
  your email connector.

1. If you want the email notifications to contain links back to the case, you
  must configure the [server.publicBaseUrl]({kibana-ref}/settings.html#server-publicBaseUrl) setting.

When you subsequently add assignees to cases, they receive an email.

Add a Lens visualization to your case to portray event and alert data through charts and graphs.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/cases-open-manage/-cases-add-vis-to-case.gif[Shows how to add a visualization to a case]

To add a Lens visualization to a comment within your case:

. Click the **Visualization** button. The **Add visualization** dialog appears.
. Select an existing visualization from your Visualize Library or create a new visualization.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Set an absolute time range for your visualization. This ensures your visualization doesn't change over time after you save it to your case, and provides important context for others managing the case.
====
. Save the visualization to your Visualize Library by clicking the **Save to library** button (optional).
+
.. Enter a title and description for the visualization.
.. Choose if you want to keep the **Update panel on Security** activated. This option is activated by default and automatically adds the visualization to your Visualize Library.
. After you've finished creating your visualization, click **Save and return** to go back to your case.
. Click **Preview** to show how the visualization will appear in the case comment.
. Click **Add Comment** to add the visualization to your case.

Alternatively, while viewing a <<security-dashboards-overview,dashboard>> you can open a panel's menu then click **More actions** (image:images/icons/boxesHorizontal.svg[More actions]​) → **Add to existing case** or **More actions** (image:images/icons/boxesHorizontal.svg[More actions]​) → **Add to new case**.

After a visualization has been added to a case, you can modify or interact with it by clicking the **Open Visualization** option in the case's comment menu.

[[cases-export-import]]
== Export and import cases

Cases can be <<cases-export,exported>> and <<cases-import,imported>> as saved objects using the Saved Objects <<security-project-settings,project settings>> UI.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before importing Lens visualizations, Timelines, or alerts, ensure their data is present. Without it, they won't work after being imported.
====

[discrete]
[[cases-export]]
=== Export a case

Use the **Export** option to move cases between different {elastic-sec} instances. When you export a case, the following data is exported to a newline-delimited JSON (`.ndjson`) file:

* Case details
* User actions
* Text string comments
* Case alerts
* Lens visualizations (exported as JSON blobs).

[NOTE]
====
The following attachments are _not_ exported:

* **Case files**: Case files are not exported. However, they are accessible in **Project settings** → **Management** → **Files** to download and re-add.
* **Alerts**: Alerts attached to cases are not exported. You must re-add them after importing cases.
====

To export a case:

. Go to **Project settings** → **Management** → **Saved objects**.
. Search for the case by choosing a saved object type or entering the case title in the search bar.
. Select one or more cases, then click the **Export** button.
. Click **Export**. A confirmation message that your file is downloading displays.
+
[TIP]
====
Keep the **Include related objects** option enabled to ensure connectors are exported too.
====

[role="screenshot"]

[[cases-import]]
=== Import a case

To import a case:

. Go to **Project settings** → **Management** → **Saved objects**.
. Click **Import**.
. Select the NDJSON file containing the exported case and configure the import options.
. Click **Import**.
. Review the import log and click **Done**.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Be mindful of the following:

* If the imported case had connectors attached to it, you'll be prompted to re-authenticate the connectors. To do so, click **Go to connectors** on the **Import saved objects** flyout and complete the necessary steps. Alternatively, open the main menu, then go to **Project settings** → **Management** → **{connectors-ui}** to access connectors.
* If the imported case had attached alerts, verify that the alerts' source documents exist in the environment. Case features that interact with alerts (such as the Alert details flyout and rule details page) rely on the alerts' source documents to function.
