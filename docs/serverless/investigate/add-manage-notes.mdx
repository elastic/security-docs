## Add notes to Timelines

<DocCallOut title="Important" color="warning">
You can only add notes to saved Timelines.
</DocCallOut>

There are two ways to add notes to an open Timeline: the **Notes** Timeline tab or the details flyout for alerts and events that you're investigating in Timeline. 

From the **Notes** Timeline tab, you can create a new note that's attached to the entire Timeline. From the details flyout, any notes that you add to alerts and events are automatically attached to the Timeline you're currently working on. If you only want to create a note for the alert or event, deselect the **Attach to current Timeline** option.
