   * The user who created them
   * The type of object that they're attached to (notes can be attached to alerts, events, Timelines, or nothing)
* Examine the contents of a note by clicking on the text in the **Note content** column  
* Delete individual or multiple notes 
* Preview the alert or event that a note is attached to
* Open the note in Timeline (this option is only available for alerts or events with notes attached to a saved Timeline)
