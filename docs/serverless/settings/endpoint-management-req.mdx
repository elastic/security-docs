You can create user roles and define privileges to manage feature access in ((kib)). This allows you to use the principle of least privilege while managing access to ((elastic-defend))'s features.

Roles and privileges are configured in **Stack Management** → **Roles** in ((kib)). For more details on using this UI, refer to [((kib)) privileges](((kibana-ref))/kibana-role-management.html#adding_kibana_privileges). 

<DocCallOut title="Note">
((elastic-defend))'s feature privileges must be assigned to **All Spaces**. You can't assign them to an individual ((kib)) space. 
</DocCallOut>

To grant access, select **All** for the **Security** feature in the **((kib)) privileges** configuration UI, then turn on the **Customize sub-feature privileges** switch. For each of the following sub-feature privileges, select the type of access you want to allow:

* **All**: Users have full access to the feature, which includes performing all available actions and managing configuration.
* **Read**: Users can view the feature, but can't perform any actions or manage configuration. (Some features don't have this privilege.)
* **None**: Users can't access or view the feature.

## Upgrade considerations

After upgrading from ((elastic-sec)) 8.6 or earlier, existing user roles will be assigned **None** by default for any new endpoint management feature privileges, and you'll need to explicitly assign them. However, many features previously required the built-in `superuser` role, and users who previously had this role will still have it after upgrading.

You'll probably want to replace the broadly permissive `superuser` role with more focused feature-based privileges to ensure that users have access to only the specific features that they need. Refer to [((kib)) role management](((kibana-ref))/kibana-role-management.html) for more details on assigning roles and privileges.
