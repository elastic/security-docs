To use entity risk scoring and asset criticality, you need the appropriate user roles. These features require the Security Analytics Complete <DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/manage-project">project feature</DocLink>.

This page covers the requirements for using the entity risk scoring and asset criticality features, as well as their known limitations.

## Entity risk scoring

### User roles

To turn on the risk scoring engine, you need one of the following <DocLink slug="/serverless/general/assign-user-roles" section="security">Security user roles</DocLink>:

* Platform engineer
* Detections admin
* Admin

### Known limitations

* The risk scoring engine uses an internal user role to score all hosts and users. After you turn on the risk scoring engine, all alerts in the project will contribute to host and user risk scores.
* You cannot customize alert data views or risk weights associated with alerts and asset criticality levels.

## Asset criticality

To use the asset criticality feature, turn on the `securitySolution:enableAssetCriticality` <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/advanced-settings" section="enable-asset-criticality-workflows" >advanced setting</DocLink>.

The following <DocLink slug="/serverless/general/assign-user-roles" section="security">Security user roles</DocLink> allow you to view an entity's asset criticality:

* Viewer
* Tier 1 analyst

The following Security user roles allow you to view, assign, change, or unassign an entity's asset criticality:
