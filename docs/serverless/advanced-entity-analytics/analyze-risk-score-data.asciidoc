The {security-app} provides several options to monitor the change in the risk posture of hosts and users from your environment. Use the following places in the {security-app} to view and analyze risk score data:

* <<security-analyze-risk-score-data-entity-analytics-dashboard,Entity Analytics dashboard>>
* <<security-analyze-risk-score-data-alerts-page,Alerts page>>
* <<security-analyze-risk-score-data-alert-details-flyout,Alert details flyout>>
* <<security-analyze-risk-score-data-hosts-and-users-pages,Hosts and Users pages>>
* <<security-analyze-risk-score-data-host-and-user-details-pages,Host and user details pages>>
* <<security-analyze-risk-score-data-host-and-user-details-flyouts,Host and user details flyouts>>

[[security-analyze-risk-score-data-entity-analytics-dashboard]]
== Entity Analytics dashboard

From the Entity Analytics dashboard, you can access entity key performance indicators (KPIs), risk scores, and levels. You can also click the number link in the **Alerts** column to investigate and analyze the alerts on the Alerts page.

[[security-analyze-risk-score-data-alert-triaging]]
== Alert triaging

You can prioritize alert triaging to analyze alerts associated with risky or business-critical entities using the following features in the {security-app}.

[[security-analyze-risk-score-data-alerts-page]]
=== Alerts page

Use the Alerts table to investigate and analyze:

* Host and user risk levels
* Host and user risk scores
* Asset criticality

To display entity risk score and asset criticality data in the Alerts table, select **Fields**, and add the following:

* `user.risk.calculated_level` or `host.risk.calculated_level`
* `user.risk.calculated_score_norm` or `host.risk.calculated_score_norm`
* `user.asset.criticality` or `host.asset.criticality`

[[security-analyze-risk-score-data-triage-alerts-associated-with-high-risk-or-business-critical-entities]]
==== Triage alerts associated with high-risk or business-critical entities

To analyze alerts associated with high-risk or business-critical entities, you can filter or group them by entity risk level or asset criticality level.

[NOTE]
====
If you change the entity's criticality level after an alert is generated, that alert document will include the original criticality level and will not reflect the new criticality level.
====

* Use the drop-down filter controls to filter alerts by entity risk level or asset criticality level. To do this, <<drop-down-filter-controls,edit the default controls>> to filter by:
+
** `user.risk.calculated_level` or `host.risk.calculated_level` for entity risk level:
+

* To group alerts by entity risk level or asset criticality level, select **Group alerts by**, then select **Custom field** and search for:
+
** `host.risk.calculated_level` or `user.risk.calculated_level` for entity risk level:

** You can further sort the grouped alerts by highest entity risk score:
+
... Expand a risk level group (for example, **High**) or an asset criticality group (for example, **high_impact**).
... Select **Sort fields** → **Pick fields to sort by**.
... Select fields in the following order:
+
.... `host.risk.calculated_score_norm` or `user.risk.calculated_score_norm`: **High-Low**
.... `Risk score`: **High-Low**
.... `@timestamp`: **New-Old**
