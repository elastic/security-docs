To run and create ((ml)) jobs and rules, you need the appropriate <DocLink slug="/serverless/general/assign-user-roles">user role</DocLink>.

Additionally, for <DocLink slug="/serverless/custom-roles">custom roles</DocLink>, to configure <DocLink slug="/serverless/security/alert-suppression">alert suppression</DocLink> for ((ml)) rules, your role needs the following index privilege:

* `read` permission for the `.ml-anomalies-*` index

For more information, go to [Set up ((ml-features))](((ml-docs))/setup.html).

<DocCallOut title="Important" color="warning">

Some roles give
access to the results of _all_ ((anomaly-jobs)), irrespective of whether the user
has access to the source indices. Likewise, a user who has full or read-only
access to ((ml-features)) within a given ((kib)) space can view the results of _all_
((anomaly-jobs)) that are visible in that space. You must carefully consider who
is given these roles and feature privileges; ((anomaly-job)) results may propagate
field values that contain sensitive information from the source indices to the
results.
