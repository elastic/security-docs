=== Known limitations

* The risk scoring engine uses an internal user role to score all hosts and users. After you turn on the risk scoring engine, all alerts in the project will contribute to host and user risk scores.
* You cannot customize alert data views or risk weights associated with alerts and asset criticality levels.
