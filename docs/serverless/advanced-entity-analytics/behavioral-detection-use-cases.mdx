<DocBadge template="technical preview" />

Behavioral detection identifies potential internal and external threats based on user and host activity. It uses a threat-centric approach to flag suspicious activity by analyzing patterns, anomalies, and context enrichment. 

The behavioral detection feature is built on ((elastic-sec))'s foundational SIEM detection capabilities, leveraging ((ml)) algorithms to enable proactive threat detection and hunting.

## Elastic integrations for behavioral detection use cases

Behavioral detection integrations provide a convenient way to enable behavioral detection capabilities. They streamline the deployment of components that implement behavioral detection, such as data ingestion, transforms, rules, ((ml)) jobs, and scripts.

* Behavioral detection integrations require the Security Analytics Complete <DocLink id="serverlessGeneralManageProject">project feature</DocLink>.
* To learn more about the requirements for using ((ml)) jobs, refer to <DocLink id="serverlessSecurityMlRequirements" />.

Here's a list of integrations for various behavioral detection use cases:

* [Data Exfiltration Detection](((integrations-docs))/ded)
* [Domain Generation Algorithm Detection](((integrations-docs))/dga)
* [Lateral Movement Detection](((integrations-docs))/lmd)
* [Living off the Land Attack Detection](((integrations-docs))/problemchild)
* [Network Beaconing Identification](((integrations-docs))/beaconing)

To learn more about ((ml)) jobs enabled by these integrations, refer to [Prebuilt job reference](((security-guide))/prebuilt-ml-jobs.html).
