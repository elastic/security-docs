// :description: Requirements for using {ml} jobs and rules.
// :keywords: serverless, security, reference, manage


To run and create {ml} jobs and rules, you need the appropriate <<general-assign-user-roles,user role>>.

Additionally, for <<custom-roles,custom roles>>, to configure <<security-alert-suppression,alert suppression>> for {ml} rules, your role needs the following index privilege:

* `read` permission for the `.ml-anomalies-*` index

For more information, go to {ml-docs}/setup.html[Set up {ml-features}].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Some roles give
access to the results of _all_ {anomaly-jobs}, irrespective of whether the user
has access to the source indices. Likewise, a user who has full or read-only
access to {ml-features} within a given {kib} space can view the results of _all_
{anomaly-jobs} that are visible in that space. You must carefully consider who
is given these roles and feature privileges; {anomaly-job} results may propagate
field values that contain sensitive information from the source indices to the
results.
