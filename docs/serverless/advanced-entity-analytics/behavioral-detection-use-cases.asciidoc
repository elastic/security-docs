Behavioral detection identifies potential internal and external threats based on user and host activity. It uses a threat-centric approach to flag suspicious activity by analyzing patterns, anomalies, and context enrichment.

The behavioral detection feature is built on {elastic-sec}'s foundational SIEM detection capabilities, leveraging {ml} algorithms to enable proactive threat detection and hunting.

== Elastic integrations for behavioral detection use cases

Behavioral detection integrations provide a convenient way to enable behavioral detection capabilities. They streamline the deployment of components that implement behavioral detection, such as data ingestion, transforms, rules, {ml} jobs, and scripts.

.Requirements
[NOTE]
====
* Behavioral detection integrations require the Security Analytics Complete <<elasticsearch-manage-project,project feature>>.
* To learn more about the requirements for using {ml} jobs, refer to <<security-ml-requirements>>.

Here's a list of integrations for various behavioral detection use cases:

* {integrations-docs}/ded[Data Exfiltration Detection]
* {integrations-docs}/dga[Domain Generation Algorithm Detection]
* {integrations-docs}/lmd[Lateral Movement Detection]
* {integrations-docs}/problemchild[Living off the Land Attack Detection]
* {integrations-docs}/beaconing[Network Beaconing Identification]

To learn more about {ml} jobs enabled by these integrations, refer to {security-guide}/prebuilt-ml-jobs.html[Prebuilt job reference].
