== Threat intelligence and indicators
If you are unfamiliar with what threat intelligence is, think of it as a research function that helps inform the actions and decisions that an organization makes to protect itself. An organization's security operation center (SOC) team is usually responsible for managing threat intelligence. Their goals are to understand current and emerging threats so they can recommend actions that prevent, stop, and mitigate threats.

An indicator, which may also be referred to as an Indicator of Compromise (IoC), is a piece of information that represents a known malicious threat or reported vulnerability. There are many different types of indicators, including URLs, files, domains, email addresses and more. Threat intelligence analysts within SOC teams use indicators to detect, assess, and respond to threats.
