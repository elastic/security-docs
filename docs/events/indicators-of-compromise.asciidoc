On the Intelligence page, indicators are visualized in a Trend view, which shows the occurrence of indicators over time. The Indicators table displays indicator data that was ingested from enabled threat intelligence feeds. You can search, filter, and take actions on any of the data in the Indicators table and Trend view.

This topic defines threat intelligence and indicators, then shows you how to ingest and work with indicators from the Intelligence page.

== Threat intelligence and indicators
If you are unfamiliar with what threat intelligence is, think of it as a research function that helps inform the actions and decisions that an organization makes to protect itself. An organization's security operation center (SOC) team is usually responsible for managing threat intelligence. Their goals are to understand current and emerging threats so they can recommend actions that prevent, stop, and mitigate threats.

An indicator, which may also be referred to as an Indicator of Compromise (IoC), is a piece of information that represents a known malicious threat or reported vulnerability. There are many different types of indicators, including URLs, files, domains, email addresses and more. Threat intelligence analysts within SOC teams use indicators to detect, assess, and respond to threats.

. Choose one of the following:
.. From the {security-app} main menu, click the Intelligence page, then click *Add Integrations*.
.. From the {kib} main menu and click *Add integrations*. Scroll down list of integration categories and select *Threat Intelligence* to filter for threat intelligence integrations.
