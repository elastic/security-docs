== Threat intelligence and indicators
Threat intelligence is a research function that helps an organization make informed security decisions and actions. An organization's security operations center (SOC) team usually manages threat intelligence, which helps them understand current and emerging threats and recommend actions that will prevent, stop, and mitigate security threats.

An indicator, also referred to as an indicator of compromise (IoC), is a piece of information associated with a known threat or reported vulnerability. There are many types of indicators, including URLs, files, domains, email addresses, and more. Within SOC teams, threat intelligence analysts use indicators to detect, assess, and respond to threats.
