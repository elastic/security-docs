[[indicators-of-compromise]]
= Indicators of compromise

The Intelligence page collects data from enabled threat intelligence feeds and displays it in the Indicators table to provide with a central place for examining and investigating threat indicators.

Threat intelligence is a research function that sits within the security operation center (SOC) that is responsible for understanding current and emerging threats and recommending actions against these threats to protect their organizations. An indicator, also referred to as an indicator of compromise (IoC), is a document or a piece of information that represents a known malicious threat or reported vulnerability. There are different types of indicators including URL, file, domain, email address, and more.
