== Threat intelligence and indicators

Threat Intelligence is a research function that sits within the security operation center (SOC) that is responsible for understanding current and emerging threats and recommending actions against these threats to protect their organizations.

An indicator, also referred to as an indicator of compromise (IoC), is a document or a piece of information that represents a known malicious threat or reported vulnerability. There are different types of indicators including URL, file, domain, email address, and more.

The Intelligence page helps threat intelligence analysts gather threat intelligence in a single place and then interact with ingested indicators.
