[[add-notes-timelines]]
== Add notes to Timelines

IMPORTANT: You can only add notes to saved Timelines.  

There are two ways to add notes to a saved and open Timeline: use the **Notes** Timeline tab, or use the details flyout for alerts and events that you're investigating in Timeline. 

* From the **Notes** Timeline tab, you can create a new note that's attached to the entire Timeline. 
* From the details flyout, any notes that you add to alerts and events are automatically attached to the Timeline you're currently working on. If you want to add a note for the alert or event only, deselect the **Attach to current Timeline** option.

=== Find Timelines with notes

To find Timelines with notes, use the <<manage-notes,**Notes** page>>. Alternatively, go to the **Timelines** page (find **Timelines** in the main navigation or look for “Timelines” using the {kibana-ref}/introduction.html#kibana-navigation-search[global search field]), open the appropriate Timeline, and click the **Notes** tab. The tab display all notes that are attached to the Timeline.

[[manage-notes]]
== Manage all notes 

//Will need to revisit the navigation instructions below. The nav path to the Notes page differs between the Classic nav view (Manage -> Investigations -> Notes) and the Security solution view (Investigations -> Notes)

Use the **Notes** page to view and interact with all existing notes. From the page, you can:

* Search for specific notes
* Filter notes by:
** The user who created the notes
** The type of object that notes are attached to (notes can be attached to alerts, events, Timelines, or nothing)
* Examine the contents of a note (click the text in the **Note content** column)
* Delete one or more notes 
* Examine the alert or event that a note is attached to (click the image:images/notes-page-document-details.png[Add note,15,15] icon to preview the alert or event)
* Open the note in Timeline (only available for notes attached to saved Timelines, or alerts or events with notes attached to saved Timelines)
