== View and add notes to alerts and events

Open the alert or event details flyout to access the **Notes** tab, where you can view existing notes and add new ones. To quickly open the tab, click the **Add note** action (image:images/create-note-icon.png[Add note action,15,15]) in the Alerts or Events table. Then, enter a note into the text box, and click **Add note** to create it.

After notes are created, the **Add note** icon displays a notification dot. In the details flyout for alerts, the alert summary in the right panel also shows how many notes are attached to the alert.

[[notes-timelines]]
== View and add notes to Timelines

IMPORTANT: You can only add notes to saved Timelines.  

Open the **Notes** Timeline tab, where you can view existing notes for the Timeline and add new ones. Alternatively, use the details flyout for alerts and events that you're investigating from Timeline. Be aware that notes added this way are automatically attached to the alert or event and the Timeline unless you deselect the **Attach to current Timeline** option. 

After notes are created, the **Notes** Timeline tab displays the total number of notes attached to the Timeline.
