== Add notes to Timelines

IMPORTANT: You can only add notes to saved Timelines.  

There are two ways to add notes to a saved and open Timeline: use the **Notes** Timeline tab, or use the details flyout for alerts and events that you're investigating in Timeline. 

* From the **Notes** Timeline tab, you can create a new note that's attached to the entire Timeline. 
* From the details flyout, any notes that you add to alerts and events are automatically attached to the Timeline you're currently working on. If you want to add a note for the alert or event only, deselect the **Attach to current Timeline** option.

[[manage-notes]]
== Find and manage notes 

//Will need to revisit the navigation instructions below. The nav path to the Notes page differs between the Classic nav view (Manage -> Investigations -> Notes) and the Security solution view (Investigations -> Notes)

The **Notes** page allows you to view and interact with all existing notes. To access the page, find **Investigations** in the main menu or look for “Investigations” using the {kibana-ref}/introduction.html#kibana-navigation-search[global search field], then go to **Notes**.

TIP: You can also manage notes for alerts, events, and Timelines from the **Notes** <<expanded-notes-view,tab>> in the details flyout or in Timeline.
