[[timelines-ui]]
= Investigate events in Timeline

Use Timeline as your workspace for investigations and threat hunting.
You can add alerts from multiple indices to a Timeline to facilitate advanced investigations.

You can drag or send fields of interest to a Timeline to create the desired query. For example, you can add fields from tables and histograms
on the *Overview*, *Alerts*, *Hosts*, and *Network* pages, as well as from
other Timelines. Alternatively, you can add a query directly in Timeline
by clicking *+ Add field*.

Timelines are responsive, and they persist as you move through the {security-app}
collecting data. Auto-saving ensures that the results of your investigation are
available for later review. To record and share your findings with others, attach your Timeline to a <<cases-overview, case>>.

TIP: Untitled Timelines are saved as drafts. To attach a Timeline to a
<<cases-overview, case>>, you must give it a title.

In addition to Timelines, you can create and attach Timeline templates to
<<detection-engine-overview, detection rules>>. Timeline templates allow you to
define the source event fields used when you investigate alerts in
Timeline. You can select whether the fields use predefined values or values
retrieved from the alert. For more information, refer to <<timeline-templates-ui>>.


[discrete]
[[refine-timeline-results]]
== View and refine Timeline results

You can select whether Timeline displays detection alerts and other raw events, or just alerts. By default, Timeline displays both raw events and alerts. To hide raw events and display alerts only, click *Data view* to the right of the date and time picker, then select *Show only detection alerts*.

[discrete]
[[timeline-inspect-events-alerts]]
== Inspect an event or alert
To further inspect an event or detection alert, click the *View details* button. A flyout with event or <<view-alert-details,alert details>> appears.

[discrete]
[[conf-timeline-display]]
== Configure Timeline event context and display

Many types of events automatically appear in preconfigured views that provide relevant
contextual information, called *Event Renderers*. You can display and turn them on or off
with the Settings menu in the upper left corner of the results pane:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/timeline-ui-renderer.png[example timeline with the event renderer highlighted]

The example above displays the Flow event renderer, which highlights the movement of
data between its source and destination. If you see a particular part of the rendered event that
interests you, you can drag it up to the drop zone below the query bar for further investigation.

You can also modify a Timeline's display in other ways:

* Add, remove, reorder, or resize columns
* Create <<runtime-fields,runtime fields>> and display them in the Timeline
* View the Timeline in full screen mode
* Add or delete notes on individual events
* Add or delete investigation notes on the entire Timeline
* Pin interesting events to the Timeline

[discrete]
[[narrow-expand]]
== Narrow or expand your KQL query

By placing fields within the drop zone, you turn them into query filters.
Their relative placement specifies their logical relationships: horizontally adjacent filters use `AND`,
while vertically adjacent filters use `OR`.

[discrete]
[[pivot]]
== Edit existing filters

Click a filter to access additional operations such as *Add filter*, *Clear all*, *Load saved query*, and more:

Here are examples of various types of filters:

Field with value::
Filters for events with the specified field value:
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/timeline-filter-value.png[width=30%]

Field exists::
Filters for events containing the specified field:
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/timeline-field-exists.png[width=30%]

Exclude results::
Filters for events that do not contain the specified field value
(`field with value` filter) or the specified field (`field exists` filter):
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/timeline-filter-exclude.png[width=30%]

Temporarily disable::
The filter is not used in the query until it is enabled again:

image::images/timeline-disable-filter.png[width=30%]

Filter for field present::
Converts a `field with value` filter to a `field exists` filter.

NOTE: When you convert a <<timeline-templates-ui, Timeline template>> to a
Timeline, some fields may be disabled. For more information, refer to
<<template-legend-ui>>.

[discrete]
[[timeline-to-cases-ui]]
== Attach Timeline to a case

To attach a Timeline to a new or existing case, open it, click *Attach to case* in the upper right corner,
then select either *Attach to new case* or *Attach to existing case*.

To learn more about cases, refer to <<cases-overview, Cases>>.

[discrete]
[[manage-timelines-ui]]
== Manage existing Timelines

You can view, duplicate, export, delete, and create templates from existing Timelines:

. Go to *Timelines*.
. Click the *All actions* menu in the desired row, then select an action:

* *Create template from timeline* (refer to <<timeline-templates-ui>>)
* *Duplicate timeline*
* *Export selected* (refer to <<import-export-timelines>>)
* *Delete selected*
* *Create query rule from timeline* (only available if the Timeline contains a KQL query)
* *Create EQL rule from timeline* (only available if the Timeline contains an EQL query)

TIP: To perform an action on multiple Timelines, first select the Timelines,
then select an action from the *Bulk actions* menu.

[discrete]
[[import-export-timelines]]
== Export and import Timelines

You can export and import Timelines, which enables you to share Timelines from one
{kib} space or instance to another. Exported Timelines are saved as
http://ndjson.org[`.ndjson`] files.

To export Timelines:

* Go to *Timelines*.
* Either click the *All actions* menu in the relevant row and select *Export selected*, or select multiple Timelines and then click *Bulk actions* -> *Export selected*.

To import Timelines:

* Click *Import*, then select or drag and drop the relevant `.ndjson` file.

+
NOTE: Multiple Timeline objects are delimited with newlines.


[discrete]
[[filter-with-eql]]
== Filter Timeline results with EQL
Use the *Correlation* tab to investigate Timeline results with {ref}/eql.html[EQL queries].

When forming EQL queries, you can write a basic query to return a list of events and alerts. Or, you can create sequences of EQL queries to view matched, ordered events across multiple event categories. Sequence queries are useful for identifying and predicting related events. They can also provide a more complete picture of potential adversary behavior in your environment, which you can use to create or update rules and detection alerts.

The following image shows what matched ordered events look like in the Timeline table. Events that belong to the same sequence are matched together in groups and shaded red or blue. Matched events are also ordered from oldest to newest in each sequence.

From the *Correlation* tab, you can also do the following:

* Specify the date and time range that you want to investigate.
* Reorder the columns and choose which fields to display.
* Choose a data view and whether to show detection alerts only.

[[esql-in-timeline]]
== Use {esql} to investigate events 

preview::[]

The {ref}/esql.html[Elasticsearch Query Language ({esql})] provides a powerful way to filter, transform, and analyze event data stored in {es}. {esql} queries use "pipes" to manipulate and transform data in a step-by-step fashion. This approach allows you to compose a series of operations, where the output of one operation becomes the input for the next, enabling complex data transformations and analysis.

You can use {esql} in Timeline by opening the **{esql}** tab. From there, you can: 

- Explore your events using the default query, or create a custom one. The default query searches documents within the Security alert index (`.alerts-security.alerts-default`) and indices specified in the <<update-sec-indices,Security data view>>, then returns 10 events from the defined time range.  
- Click the help icon (image:images/esql-ref-button.png[Click the ES|QL reference button,20,20]) on the far right side of the query editor to open the in-product reference documentation for all {esql} commands and functions.  
- Visualize query results using {kibana-ref}/discover.html[Discover] functionality.

[[esql-in-timeline-resources]]
=== Additional {esql} resources 

To get started using {esql}, read the tutorial for {ref}/esql-kibana.html[using {esql} in {kib}]. Much of the functionality available in {kib} is also available in Timeline.
