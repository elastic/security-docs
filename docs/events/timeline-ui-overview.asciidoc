[[timelines-ui]]
= Investigating events in Timeline

Use Timeline as your workspace for investigations and threat hunting.
Data from multiple indices can be added to a Timeline, which enables
investigating complex threats.

You can drag or send items of interest to Timeline to create the query you need
to investigate an alert or event. You can add items from tables and histograms
on the *Overview*, *Detections*, *Hosts* and *Network* pages, as well as from
within a Timeline itself. Additionally, you can add a query directly in Timeline
(click `+ Add field`).

Timelines are responsive, and they persist as you move through the {es-sec-app}
collecting data. Auto-saving ensures that the results of your investigation are
available for review by other analysts and incident response teams. To record
and share your findings with others, attach your Timeline to a
<<cases-overview, case>>.

TIP: An untitled Timeline is saved as a draft. To attach a Timeline to a
<<cases-overview, case>>, you must give it a title.

In addition to Timelines, you can create and attach Timeline templates to
<<detection-engine-overview, detection rules>>. Timeline templates allow you to
define the source event fields used when you investigate a detections alert in
Timeline. You can select whether the fields use predefined values or values
retrieved from the alert. For more information, see <<timeline-templates-ui>>.

[[refine-timeline-results]]
== View and refine Timeline results

Using the drop-down options
by the KQL bar, you can select whether <<det-engine-terminology, alerts>>,
other raw events, or both are displayed in the Timeline.

[discrete]
[[conf-timeline-display]]
== Configure Timeline event context and display

Many events in Timeline are presented in easy-to-follow rendered views that
include relevant contextual information. These views are called
*Event Renderers*, and they can be configured via the Settings icon in the upper
left corner of the result's pane:

[role="screenshot"]

The example above displays a flow event renderer. If you see a particular item
that interests you, you can drag it to the dropzone for further investigation.

Other display options include:

* View in full screen mode
* Add, remove, reorder, and resize columns
* Add notes to individual events
* Add investigation notes for the entire Timeline
* Pin interesting events in the Timeline

[[narrow-expand]]
== Narrow or expand your query

You can specify logical `AND` and `OR` operations with an item's placement in
the drop area. Multiple horizontal filters use `AND` logic, vertical filters use
`OR`.

[discrete]
[[pivot]]
== Edit existing filters

Click a filter to access additional operations such as exclude, temporarily
disable, or delete items from the query:

This is how the filters appear in the UI:

Field with value::
Filters for events with the specified field value:
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/timeline-filter-value.png[width=30%]

Field exists::
Filters for events containing the specified field:
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/timeline-field-exists.png[width=30%]

Exclude results::
Filters for events that do not contain the specified field value
(`field with value` filter) or the specified field (`field exists` filter):
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/timeline-filter-exclude.png[width=30%]

Temporarily disable::
The filter is not used in the query until it is enabled again:
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/timeline-disable-filter.png[width=30%]

Filter for field present::
Converts a `field with value` filter to a `field exists` filter.

NOTE: When you convert a <<timeline-templates-ui, Timeline template>> to a
Timeline, some fields may be disabled. For more information, see
<<template-legend-ui>>.

[[timeline-to-cases-ui]]
== Attach Timeline to a case

To attach a Timeline to a new or existing case, click the Settings in the upper
right corner, and then select one of these:

* _Attach timeline to new case_
* _Attach timeline to existing case_

For more information about cases, see <<cases-overview, Cases>>.

[[manage-timelines-ui]]

You can view, duplicate, delete, and create templates from existing Timelines:

. Go to *Security* -> *Timelines*.

* _Create template from timeline_ (see <<timeline-templates-ui>>)
* _Duplicate timeline_
* _Delete timeline_

TIP: To perform the same action on multiple Timelines, select Timelines and
then the required action from the _Bulk actions_ menu.

[discrete]
[[import-export-timelines]]
== Export and import Timelines

You can import and export Timelines, which enables importing Timelines from one
{kib} space or instance to another. Exported Timelines are saved in an
http://ndjson.org[`ndjson`] file.

. Go to *Security* -> *Timelines*.
. To export Timelines, do one of the following:

* To export one Timeline, click the *All actions* icon in the relevant row and
then select _Export selected_.
* To export multiple Timelines, select all the required Timelines and then click
*Bulk actions* -> _Export selected_.

. To import Timelines, click *Import Timeline* and then select or drag-and-drop
the Timeline `ndjson` file.
+
NOTE: Each Timeline object in the file must be represented in a single line.
Multiple Timeline objects are delimited with newlines.

== Timeline accessibility features

Accessibility features, such as keyboard focus and screen reader support, are built into the Timeline as well. These features offer additional ways to navigate through the interface and interact with draggable and static elements in the Timeline.

=== Interacting with Draggable Timeline Elements
[discrete]
From the Timeline tab, you can use your keyboard to do one of the following:

* Select a draggable element on the Timeline to give it keyboard focus.
* Once an element has keyboard focus, press *Enter* to display its menu.
* Use the spacebar to drag-and-drop an element to a different location.

=== Navigating the Timeline Tab
[discrete]
From the Timeline tab, you can use your keyboard to do one of the following:

* Use the directional arrows to move the keyboard focus right, left, up, and down.
* Use *CTRL + Home* to shift the focus to the first cell in a row. Likewise, use *CTRL + End* to move the focus to the last cell in the row.
* Use the *Page Up* and *Page Down* keys to scroll through the page.
