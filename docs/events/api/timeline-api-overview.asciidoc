== Timeline API

You can create Timelines and Timeline templates via the API, as well as import new Timelines from an `ndjson` file.

NOTE: The {kib} Console supports only Elasticsearch APIs. You cannot interact with the {kib} APIs with the Console and must use `curl` or another HTTP tool instead. For more information, refer to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/console-kibana.html[Console].
