== Timeline API

You can create Timelines and Timeline templates via the API, as well as import new Timelines from an `ndjson` file.

NOTE: Console supports only Elasticsearch APIs. Console doesn't allow interactions with {kib} APIs. You must use `curl` or another HTTP tool instead. For more information, refer to {kibana-ref}/console-kibana.html[Run {es} API requests].
