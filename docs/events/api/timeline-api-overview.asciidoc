== Timeline API

You can create Timelines and Timeline templates via the API, as well as import new Timelines from an `ndjson` file.

NOTE: Console now supports sending requests to {kib} APIs: prepend any {kib} API endpoint with `kbn:` and send the request via Console, for example, `GET kbn:/api/index_management/indices`.
