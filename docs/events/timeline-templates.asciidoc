== About Timeline templates

You can attach Timeline templates to detection rules. When attached, the rule's
alerts use the template when they are investigated in Timeline. This enables
immediately viewing the alert's most interesting fields when you start an
investigation.

Templates can include two type of filters:

* *'Regular' filter*: Like other {kib} KQL filters, defines both the source
event field and its value. For example: `host.name : "win-server"`.
* *Template filter*: Only defines the event field, and uses a placeholder
for the field's value. When you investigate an alert in Timeline, the field's
value is taken from the alert.

For example, if you define the `host.name: "{host.name}"` template filter, when
alerts generated by the rule are investigated in Timeline, the alert's
`host.name` value is used in the filter. If the alert's `host.name` value is
`Linux_stafordshire-061`, the Timeline filter is:
`host.name: "Linux_stafordshire-061"`.

NOTE: For information on how to add Timeline templates to rules, see
<<create-rule-ui>>.

When you load {es-sec} prebuilt rules, some prebuilt Timeline templates are
also loaded. You can attach these templates to detection rules. The following
templates are loaded:

* `Generic Endpoint Timeline`: Useful for investigating Elastic Endpoint
security alerts.
* `Generic Process Timeline`: Useful for investigating process-related alerts.
* `Generic Network Timeline`: Useful for investigating network-related alerts.

TIP: You can <<man-templates-ui, duplicate prebuilt templates>> and use them as
a starting point for your own custom templates.

=== Timeline template legend

When you add filters to a Timelime template, the items are color coded to
indicate which type of filter is added. Additionally, you change Timeline
filters to template filters as you build your template.

'Regular' Timeline filter::
Click `Convert to template field` changes the filter to a template filter:

Template filter::

When you <<man-templates-ui, convert a template to a Timeline>>, template
filters with placeholders are disabled:

To enable the filter, either specify a value or change it to a field exists
filter (see <<pivot>>).

=== Create a Timeline template

. Go to *Security* -> *Timelines*.
. Click the *Templates* tab, and then *Create new timeline template*.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/create-template-ui.png[]

. Give the template a title.
. Optionally, add a description and notes.
. To add filters, click *Add field*, and then select the required option:

* _Add field_: Add a `regular` Timeline filter.
* _Add template field_: Add a template filter with a value placeholder.

TIP: You can also drag and send items to the template from the *Overview*,
*Hosts*, *Network*, and *Detections* pages.

*Example*

To create a template for process-related alerts on a specific host:

* Add an 'ordinary' filter for the host name:
`host.name: "Linux_stafordshire-061"`
* Add template filter for process names: `process.name: "{process.name}"`

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/template-query-example.png[]

When alerts generated by rules associated with this template are investigated
in Timeline, the host name is `Linux_stafordshire-061`, whereas the process name
value is retrieved from the alert's `process.name` field.
