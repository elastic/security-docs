= Host isolation exceptions

You can configure host isolation exceptions for specific IP addresses that <<host-isolation-ov, isolated hosts>> are still allowed to communicate with, even when blocked from the rest of your network. Isolated hosts can still send data to {es} and {kib}, so you don't need to set up host isolation exceptions for them.

Host isolation exceptions support IPv4 addresses, with optional classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) notation.

You must have the *Host Isolation Exceptions* <<endpoint-management-req,privilege>> to access this feature.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Each host isolation exception IP address should be a highly trusted and secure location since you're allowing it to communicate with hosts that have been isolated to prevent a potential threat from spreading.

* If your hosts depend on VPNs for network communication, you should also set up host isolation exceptions for those VPN servers' IP addresses.
====

Host isolation is a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or Enterprise subscription] feature. By default, a host isolation exception is recognized globally across all hosts running {elastic-defend}. You can also assign a host isolation exception to a specific {elastic-defend} integration policy, affecting only the hosts assigned to that policy.

. Go to **Manage** -> **Host isolation exceptions**.
. Click **Add Host isolation exception**.
. Fill in these fields in the **Add Host isolation exception** flyout:
.. `Name your host isolation exceptions`: Enter a name to identify the host isolation exception.
.. `Description`: Enter a description to provide more information on the host isolation exception (optional).
.. `Enter IP Address`: Enter the IP address for which you want to allow communication with an isolated host. This must be an IPv4 address, with optional CIDR notation (for example, `0.0.0.0` or `1.0.0.0/24`, respectively).
. Select an option in the *Assignment* section to assign the host isolation exception to a specific integration policy:
+
* `Global`: Assign the host isolation exception to all integration policies for {elastic-defend}.
* `Per Policy`: Assign the host isolation exception to one or more specific {elastic-defend} integration policies. Select each policy where you want the host isolation exception to apply.
+
NOTE: You can also select the `Per Policy` option without immediately assigning a policy to the host isolation exception. For example, you could do this to create and review your host isolation exception configurations before putting them into action with a policy.
. Click **Add Host isolation exception**. The new exception is added to the *Host isolation exceptions* list.
