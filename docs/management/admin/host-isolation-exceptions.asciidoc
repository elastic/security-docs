= Host isolation exceptions

You can configure host isolation exceptions to allow <<host-isolation-ov, isolated hosts>> to communicate with one or more specific IP addresses after they've been blocked from the rest of your network. Remember, isolated hosts can still send data to {es} and {kib}, so you don't need to set up host isolation exceptions for them.

IMPORTANT: Each host isolation exception IP address should be a highly trusted and secure location, since youâ€™re allowing it to communicate with hosts that you've isolated due to suspicious activity.

. Go to **Manage** -> **Host isolation exceptions**.
. Click **Add Host isolation exception**.
. Fill in these fields in the **Add Host isolation exception** flyout:
.. `Name your host isolation exceptions`: Enter a name to identify the host isolation exception.
.. `Description`: Enter a description to provide more information on the host isolation exception (optional).
.. `Enter IP Address`: Enter the IP address that you want an isolated host to be able to communicate with.
. Click **Add Host isolation exception**.
