= Host isolation exceptions

You can configure host isolation exceptions for specific IP addresses that <<host-isolation-ov, isolated hosts>> are still allowed to communicate with, even when blocked from the rest of your network. Isolated hosts can still send data to {es} and {kib}, so you don't need to set up host isolation exceptions for them.

Host isolation exceptions support IPv4 addresses, with optional classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) notation.

IMPORTANT: Each host isolation exception IP address should be a highly trusted and secure location, since you’re allowing it to communicate with hosts that you've isolated to contain a potential threat and prevent it from spreading.

. Go to **Manage** -> **Host isolation exceptions**.
. Click **Add Host isolation exception**.
. Fill in these fields in the **Add Host isolation exception** flyout:
.. `Name your host isolation exceptions`: Enter a name to identify the host isolation exception.
.. `Description`: Enter a description to provide more information on the host isolation exception (optional).
.. `Enter IP Address`: Enter the IP address that you want an isolated host to be able to communicate with. This must be an IPv4 address, with optional CIDR notation (for example, `0.0.0.0` or `1.0.0.0/24` respectively).
. Click **Add Host isolation exception**.
