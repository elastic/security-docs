= Host isolation exceptions

You can configure host isolation exceptions to allow isolated hosts to communicate with one or more specific IP addresses after they’ve been disconnected from the rest of your network. These exceptions will be the only network resources that an isolated host can access, and host isolation exceptions are applied to all isolated hosts.

IMPORTANT: Each host isolation exception IP address should be a highly trusted and secure location, since you’re allowing it to communicate with a host that you've isolated due to suspicious activity.

TIP: Remember, isolated hosts can still send data to {es} and {kib}, so you don’t need to set up host isolation exceptions for them.

. Go to **Manage** -> **Host isolation exceptions**.
. Click **Add Host isolation exception**.
. Fill in these fields in the **Add Host isolation exception** flyout:
.. `Name your host isolation exceptions`: Enter a name to identify the host isolation exception.
.. `Description`: Enter a description to provide more information on the host isolation exception (optional).
.. `Enter IP Address`: Enter the IP address that you want an isolated host to be able to communicate with.
. Click **Add Host isolation exception**.
