{elastic-sec} keeps a log of the <<response-actions,response actions>> performed on endpoints, such as isolating a host or terminating a process. The log displays when each command was performed, the host on which the action was performed, the {kib} user who requested the action, any comments added to the action, and the action's current status.

You must have the *Response Actions History* <<endpoint-management-req,privilege>> to access this feature.

To access the response actions history for all endpoints, go to *Manage* -> *Response actions history*. You can also access the response actions history for an individual endpoint from these areas:

* *Endpoints* page: Click an endpoint's name to open the details flyout, then click the *Response actions history* tab.
* *Response console* page: Click the *Response actions history* button.

All of these contexts contain the same information and features. The following image shows the *Response actions history* page for all endpoints:

** *Types*: Show actions based on the endpoint protection agent type ({elastic-defend} or a third-party agent), and how the action was triggered (manually by a user or automatically by a detection rule).
