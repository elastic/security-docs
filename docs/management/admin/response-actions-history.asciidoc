[[response-actions-history]]
= Response actions history

{elastic-defend} keeps a log of the <<response-actions,response actions>> performed on endpoints, such as isolating a host or terminating a process. The log displays when each command was performed, the host on which the action was performed, the {kib} user who requested the action, any comments added to the action, and the action's current status.
