= Trusted applications

You can add Windows, macOS, and Linux applications that should be trusted. By adding these trusted applications, you can use {elastic-sec} without compatibility or performance issues with other installed applications on your system. Trusted applications are applied only to hosts running {endpoint-sec}.

NOTE: You must have the built-in `superuser` role to access this feature. For more information, refer to {ref}/built-in-users.html[Built-in users].

Trusted applications are designed to help mitigate performance issues and incompatibilities with other endpoint software. However, they create blindspots for {elastic-sec}. One avenue attackers use to exploit these blindspots is by DLL (Dynamic Link Library) side-loading, where they leverage processes signed by trusted vendors -- such as antivirus software -- to execute their malicious DLLs. Such activity appears to originate from the trusted vendor's process.

By default, a trusted application is recognized globally across all hosts running {endpoint-sec}. If you have a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or Enterprise subscription], you can also assign a trusted application to a specific {endpoint-sec} integration policy, enabling the application to be trusted by only the hosts assigned to that policy.

To add a trusted application:

. Go to *Manage* -> *Trusted applications*.

. Click *Add trusted application*.

. Fill in the following fields in the *Add trusted application* flyout:

* `Name your trusted application`: Enter a name for the trusted application.

* `Description`(Optional): Enter a description for the trusted application.

* `Select operating system`: Select the appropriate operating system from the drop-down.

* `Field`: Select a field to identify the trusted application:
** `Hash`: The MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256 hash value of the application's executable.
** `Path`: The full file path of the application's executable.
** `Signature`: (Windows only) The name of the application's digital signer.
+
TIP: To find the signer's name for an application, go to *Kibana* -> *Discover* and query the process name of the application's executable (for example, `process.name : "mctray.exe"` for a McAfee security binary). Then, search the results for the `process.code_signature.subject_name` field, which contains the signer's name (for example, `McAfee, Inc.`).

* `Operator`: Select an operator to define the condition:
   ** `is`: Must be exactly equal to `Value`. This operation is required for the `Hash` and `Signature` field types.   
   ** `matches`: Can include wildcards in `Value`, such as `C:\path\*\app.exe`. This option is only available for the `Path` field type. Available wildcards are `?` (match one character) and `*` (match zero or more characters).

* `Value`: Enter the hash value, file path, or signer name. To add an additional value, click *AND*.
+
NOTE: You can only add a single field type value per trusted application. For example, if you try to add two `Path` values, you'll get an error message. Also, an application's hash value must be valid to add it as a trusted application. In addition, to minimize visibility gaps in the {security-app}, be as specific as possible in your entries. For example, combine `Signature` information with a known `Path`.

. Select an option in the *Assignment* section to assign the trusted application to a specific integration policy:
* `Global`: Assign the trusted application to all integration policies for {endpoint-sec}.
* `Per Policy` (Platinum or Enterprise subscription only): Assign the trusted application to one or more specific {endpoint-sec} integration policies. Select each policy in which you want the application to be trusted.
+
NOTE: You can also select the `Per Policy` option without immediately assigning a policy to the trusted application. For example, you could do this to create and review your trusted application configurations before putting them into action with a policy.

. Click *Add trusted application*. The application is added to the *Trusted applications* list.

[[edit-trusted-app]]
=== Edit a trusted application
You can individually modify each trusted application. With a Platinum or Enterprise subscription, you can also change the policies that a trusted application is assigned to.

To edit a trusted application:

. Click the actions menu (*...*) on the trusted application you want to edit, then select *Edit trusted application*.
. Modify details as needed.
. Click *Save*.

[[delete-trusted-app]]
=== Delete a trusted application
You can delete a trusted application, which removes it entirely from all {endpoint-sec} policies.

To delete a trusted application:

. Click the actions menu (*...*) on the trusted application you want to delete, then select *Delete trusted application*.
. On the dialog that opens, verify that you are removing the correct application, then click *Delete*. A confirmation message is displayed.
