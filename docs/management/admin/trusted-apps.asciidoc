= Trusted applications

Administrators can add Windows, macOS, and Linux applications that should be trusted. By adding these "trusted applications," you can use {elastic-sec} without compatibility or performance issues with other installed applications on your system. Trusted applications are applied only to hosts running {endpoint-sec}.

To add a trusted application:

. On the *Administration* page, select the *Trusted applications* tab.

. Click *Add Trusted Application*.

. Complete the following field requirements:

* `Name your trusted app application`: Enter a name for the trusted application.

* `Select operating system`: Select the appropriate operating system from the drop-down.

* `Field`: Select the appropriate field you want to use - *Hash* or *Path*.

* `Operator`: Defaults to `is` (i.e., "equal to"). This cannot be changed.

* `Value`: Enter the hash value or file path. To add an additional value, click *AND*.

* `Description`(Optional): Enter a description of the trusted application.

. Click *Add trusted application*. If successfully added, the added application appears in the Trusted applications list.

NOTE: Hash values must be valid to add the trusted application.

*Trusted applications list*

The *Trusted applications list* lists all the trusted applications that have been added to the {security-app}. By default, applications appear in "Grid view" -- a comprehensive display of all metadata and field values. To view a condensed version of the list that displays general information, select *List view*.

TIP: In the List view, click the arrow to expand and collapse details.

*Remove a trusted application*

. If in the Grid view, click *Remove* on the appropriate application to delete. If in the List view, click the *Remove this entry* button that looks like a trash can.

. On the "Remove trusted application" dialog that appears, confirm you are removing the correct application. If so, click *Remove trusted application*. A "Successfully removed" confirmation appears.
