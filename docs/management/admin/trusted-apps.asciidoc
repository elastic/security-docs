= Trusted applications

Users with the `superuser` role can add Windows, macOS, and Linux applications that should be trusted. By adding these trusted applications, you can use {elastic-sec} without compatibility or performance issues with other installed applications on your system. Trusted applications are applied only to hosts running {endpoint-sec}.

Trusted applications are designed to help mitigate performance issues and incompatibilities with other endpoint software. However, they create blindspots for {elastic-sec}. One avenue attackers use to exploit these blindspots is by DLL (Dynamic Link Library) side-loading, where they leverage processes signed by trusted vendors -- such as antivirus software -- to execute their malicious DLLs. Such activity appears to originate from the trusted vendor's process.

By default, a trusted application is recognized globally across all the hosts on {endpoint-sec}. If you have a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or Enterprise subscription], you can also assign a trusted application to a specific {endpoint-sec} integration policy, enabling the application to be trusted by only the hosts assigned to that policy.

To add a trusted application:

. Go to *Manage* -> *Trusted applications*.

. Click *Add trusted application*.

. Fill in the following fields in the *Add trusted application* pane:

* `Name your trusted application`: Enter a name for the trusted application.

* `Description`(Optional): Enter a description for the trusted application.

* `Select operating system`: Select the appropriate operating system from the drop-down.

* `Field`: Select the appropriate field you want to use -- `Hash`, `Path`, or (if you're adding a trusted application on Windows) `Signature`.
+
NOTE: You can only add a single field type value per trusted application. For example, if you try to add two `Path` values, you'll get an error message. Hash values must also be valid to add the trusted application. In addition, to minimize the gaps in visibility to the Security solution, be as specific as possible in your entries. For example, combine `Signature` information with known `Paths`.
+

* `Operator`: Select an operator to define the condition:
   - `is`: Must be exactly equal to `Value`. This operation is required for the `Hash` and `Signature` field types.   
   - `matches`: Can include wildcards in `Value`, such as `C:\path\*\app.exe`. This option is only available for the `Path` field type.

* `Value`: Enter the hash value or file path. To add an additional value, click *AND*.

. Select an option in the *Assignment* section to assign the trusted application to a specific integration policy:
+
* `Global`: Assign the trusted application to all integration policies for {endpoint-sec}.
* `Per Policy` (Platinum or Enterprise subscription only): Assign the trusted application to one or more specific {endpoint-sec} integration policies. Select each policy in which you want the application to be trusted.
+
NOTE: You can also select the `Per Policy` option without assigning a policy to the trusted application at this time. For example, you might want to create and review your trusted application configurations before putting them into action with a policy.

. Click *Add trusted application*. The application is added to the *Trusted applications* list.
