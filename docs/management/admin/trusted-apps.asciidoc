= Trusted applications

Users with `superuser` role can add Windows, macOS, and Linux applications that should be trusted. By adding these trusted applications, you can use {elastic-sec} without compatibility or performance issues with other installed applications on your system. Trusted applications are applied only to hosts running {endpoint-sec}.

Trusted applications are designed to help mitigate performance issues and incompatibilities with other endpoint software. However, they create blindspots for {elastic-sec}. One avenue attackers use to exploit these blindspots is by DLL (Dynamic Link Library) side-loading, where they leverage processes signed by trusted vendors -- such as antivirus software -- to execute their malicious DLLs. Such activity appears to originate from the trusted vendor's process.

To add a trusted application:

. Go to *Manage* -> *Trusted applications*.

. Click *Add trusted application*.

. Fill in the following fields in the *Add trusted application* pane:

* `Name your trusted application`: Enter a name for the trusted application.

* `Select operating system`: Select the appropriate operating system from the drop-down.

* `Field`: Select the appropriate field you want to use -- `Hash`, `Path`, or (if you are adding a trusted application on Windows) `Signature`.
+
NOTE: You can only add a single field type value per trusted application. For example, if you try to add two `Path` values, you'll get an error message. Hash values must also be valid to add the trusted application. In addition, to minimize the gaps in visibility to the Security solution, be as specific as possible in your entries. For example, combine `Signature` information with known `Paths`.
+

* `Operator`: Defaults to `is` ("equal to"). This cannot be changed.

* `Value`: Enter the hash value or file path. To add an additional value, click *AND*.

* `Description`(Optional): Enter a description for the trusted application.

. Click *Add trusted application*. The application appears in the Trusted applications list.
