[[response-actions]]
= Endpoint response actions

The response console allows you to perform response actions on an endpoint using a terminal-like interface. You can enter action commands and get near-instant feedback on them. Actions are also logged in the endpoint's <<actions-log,actions log>> for reference.

[NOTE]
=====
Response actions and the response console UI are https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Enterprise subscription] features.

Launch the response console from various contexts throughout {elastic-sec}:

* *Endpoints* page -> *Actions* menu (*...*) -> *Respond*
* Endpoint details flyout -> *Take action* -> *Respond*
* Alert details flyout -> *Take action* -> *Respond*

To perform an action on the endpoint, enter a <<response-action-commands,response action command>> in the input area at the bottom of the console, then press *Return*. Output from the action is displayed in the console.

NOTE: Some response actions may take a few seconds to complete. Once you enter a command, you can immediately enter another command while the previous action is running. 

Activity in the response console is persistent, so you can navigate away from the page and any pending actions you've submitted will continue to run. To confirm that an action completed, return to the response console to view the console output or check the <<actions-log,actions log>>.

[[response-action-commands]]
== Response action commands

The following response action commands are available in the response console.

=== `isolate`
<<host-isolation-ov,Isolate the host>>, blocking communication with other hosts on the network.

Example: `isolate --comment "Isolate host related to detection alerts"`

=== `release`
Release an isolated host, allowing it to communicate with the network again.

Example: `release --comment "Release host, everything looks OK"`

=== `status`
Show information on the host's status, including: {agent} status and version, policy status for the {endpoint-cloud-sec} integration, and when the host was last active.
 
=== `processes`
Show a list of all processes running on the host. This action may take a minute or so to complete.

TIP: Use this command to get current PID or entity ID values, which are required for other response actions such as `kill-process` and `suspend-process`.

=== `kill-process`

Terminate a process. You must include one of the following parameters to identify the process to terminate:

* `--pid` : A process ID (PID) representing the process to terminate.
* `--entityId` : An entity ID representing the process to terminate.

Example: `kill-process --pid 123 --comment "Terminate suspicious process"`

=== `suspend-process`

Temporarily suspend a process. You must include one of the following parameters to identify the process to suspend:

* `--pid` : A process ID (PID) representing the process to suspend.
* `--entityId` : An entity ID representing the process to suspend.

Example: `suspend-process --pid 123 --comment "Suspend suspicious process"`

[[supporting-commands-parameters]]
== Supporting commands and parameters

=== `--comment`

Example: `isolate --help`

=== `clear`

Clear all output from the response console.

=== `help`

TIP: You can also get a list of commands in the <<help-panel,Help panel>>, which stays on the screen independently of the output area.

[[help-panel]]
== Help panel

Click image:images/help-icon.png[Help icon,17,18] *Help* in the upper-right to open the *Help* panel, which lists available response action commands and parameters as a reference.

You can use this panel to build commands with less typing. Click the add icon (image:images/add-command-icon.png[Add icon,17,17]) to add a command to the input area, enter any additional parameters or a comment, then press *Return* to run the command.

[[actions-log]]
== Actions log

Click *Actions log* to display a history of response actions performed on the host, such as isolating the host or terminating a process. The actions log includes when each command was performed, the user who performed the action, any comments added to the action, and the action's current status. 

* Click the expand arrow on the right to display more details about an action.
* Use the date and time picker to display actions within a specific time period.

TIP: You can also access the actions log from the Endpoints page (*Manage* -> *Endpoints* -> *_Endpoint name_* -> *Actions Log*).
