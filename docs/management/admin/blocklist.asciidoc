= Blocklist

The blocklist allows you to prevent specified applications from running on hosts, extending the list of processes that {elastic-defend} considers malicious. This helps ensure that known malicious processes aren't accidentally executed by end users. 

The blocklist is not intended to broadly block benign applications for non-security reasons; only use it to block potentially harmful applications. To compare the blocklist with other endpoint artifacts, refer to <<endpoint-artifacts>>.

* In addition to configuring specific entries on the **Blocklist** page, you must also ensure that the blocklist is enabled on the {elastic-defend} integration policy in the <<malware-protection, Malware protection settings>>. This setting is enabled by default.

* You must have the *Blocklist* <<endpoint-management-req,privilege>> to access this feature.
--

By default, a blocklist entry is recognized globally across all hosts running {elastic-defend}. If you have a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or Enterprise subscription], you can also assign a blocklist entry to specific {elastic-defend} integration policies, which blocks the process only on hosts assigned to that policy.

. Go to **Manage** -> **Blocklist**.

. Click **Add blocklist entry**. The **Add blocklist** flyout appears.

. Fill in these fields in the **Details** section:
.. `Name`: Enter a name to identify the application in the blocklist.
.. `Description`: Enter a description to provide more information on the blocklist entry (optional).

. In the **Conditions** section, enter the following information about the application you want to block:
.. `Select operating system`: Select the appropriate operating system from the drop-down.
.. `Field`: Select a field to identify the application being blocked:
  * `Hash`: The MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256 hash value of the application's executable.
  * `Path`: The full file path of the application's executable.
  * `Signature`: (Windows only) The name of the application's digital signer.
+
TIP: To find the signer's name for an application, go to *Kibana* -> *Discover* and query the process name of the application's executable (for example, `process.name : "mctray.exe"` for a McAfee security binary). Then, search the results for the `process.code_signature.subject_name` field, which contains the signer's name (for example, `McAfee, Inc.`).

.. `Operator`: The operator is `is one of` and cannot be modified.

.. `Value`: Enter the hash value, file path, or signer name. To enter multiple values (such as a list of known malicious hash values), you can enter each value individually or paste a comma-delimited list, then press **Return**.
+
NOTE: Hash values must be valid to add them to the blocklist.

. Select an option in the *Assignment* section to assign the blocklist entry to a specific integration policy:
+
* `Global`: Assign the blocklist entry to all {elastic-defend} integration policies.
* `Per Policy`: Assign the blocklist entry to one or more specific {elastic-defend} integration policies. Select each policy where you want the blocklist entry to apply.
+
NOTE: You can also select the `Per Policy` option without immediately assigning a policy to the blocklist entry. For example, you could do this to create and review your blocklist configurations before putting them into action with a policy.

. Click **Add blocklist**. The new entry is added to the **Blocklist** page.

. When you're done adding entries to the blocklist, ensure that the blocklist is enabled for the {elastic-defend} integration policies that you just assigned:
.. Go to **Manage** -> **Policies**, then click on an integration policy.
.. On the **Policy settings** tab, ensure that the **Malware protections** and **Blocklist** toggles are switched on. Both settings are enabled by default.

[[edit-blocklist-entry]]
=== Edit a blocklist entry
You can individually modify each blocklist entry. With a Platinum or Enterprise subscription, you can also change the policies that a blocklist entry is assigned to.

To edit a blocklist entry:

. Click the actions menu (*...*) for the blocklist entry you want to edit, then select *Edit blocklist*.
. Modify details as needed.
. Click *Save*.

[discrete]
[[delete-blocklist-entry]]
=== Delete a blocklist entry
You can delete a blocklist entry, which removes it entirely from all {elastic-defend} policies. This allows end users to access the application that was previously blocked.

To delete a blocklist entry:

. Click the actions menu (*...*) for the blocklist entry you want to delete, then select *Delete blocklist*.
. On the dialog that opens, verify that you are removing the correct blocklist entry, then click *Delete*. A confirmation message displays.
