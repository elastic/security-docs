= Event filters

Event filters allow admins to filter endpoint events that you do not need or want stored in {es} -- for example, those with high volumes. By creating event filters, you can optimize your storage in {es}. All endpoint events have the `endpoint.events.network` field.

NOTE: You must have the built-in `superuser` role to access this feature. For more information, refer to {ref}/built-in-users.html[Built-in users].

IMPORTANT: Since an event filter blocks an event from streaming to {es}, be conscious of event filter conditions you set and any existing rule conditions. If there is too much overlap, the rule may run less frequently than specified and, therefore, will not trigger the corresponding alert for that rule. This is the expected behavior of event filters.

By default, an event filter is recognized globally across all hosts running {endpoint-sec}. If you have a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or Enterprise subscription], you can also assign an event filter to a specific {endpoint-sec} integration policy, which would filter endpoint events from the hosts assigned to that policy.

Create event filters from the Hosts page or the Event filters page.

. To create an event filter from the Hosts page:
.. Go to *Explore* -> *Hosts*.
.. Select the *Events* tab to view the Events table.
+
.. Find the event to create a filter, click the *More actions* button (*...*), then click *Add Endpoint event filter*.
+
TIP: Since you can only create filters for endpoint events, be sure to filter the Events table to display events generated by the {elastic-endpoint}. +
In the KQL search bar, enter the following query: `event.dataset : endpoint.events.network`.
+
.. Proceed to step 3.
. To create an event filter via the Event filters page:
.. Go to *Manage* -> *Event filters*.
.. Click *Add Event Filter*. The *Add event filter* flyout opens.

. Enter a name for the event filter.
. Enter a filter description (optional).
. Depending which page you are using to create the filter, either modify the pre-populated conditions or add new conditions to define when {elastic-sec} filters events. You can define multiple conditions with `AND` relationships. You can also add nested conditions. For example, the event filter pictured above excludes events whose `event.category` field is `network`, and whose `process.executable` field is as specified.
. Select an option in the *Assignment* section to assign the event filter to a specific integration policy:
+
* `Global`: Assign the event filter to all integration policies for {endpoint-sec}.
* `Per Policy` (Platinum or Enterprise subscription only): Assign the event filter to one or more specific {endpoint-sec} integration policies. Select each policy in which you want the events to be filtered.
+
NOTE: You can also select the `Per Policy` option without immediately assigning a policy to the event filter. For example, you could do this to create and review your event filter configurations before putting them into action with a policy.
. Add a comment if you want to provide more information about the event filter (optional).
. Click *Add event filter*. The new filter is added to the *Event filters* list.

== View and manage event filters

The **Event filters** list allows you to view and manage your endpoint event filters. To view the Event filters list, go to *Manage* -> *Event filters*. Event filters appear in reverse chronological order, with the most recently created at the top. Each filter has its own entry, which displays details such as the filter's name, operating system, date created, and conditions.

To refine the **Event filters** list, use the search bar to search by filter names, comments, and field values.
