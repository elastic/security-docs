= Event filters

Event filters allow admins to filter endpoint events that you do not need or want stored in {es} -- for example, those with high volumes. By creating event filters, you can optimize your storage in {es}. All endpoint events have the `endpoint.events.network` field.

By default, an event filter is recognized globally across all hosts running {endpoint-sec}. If you have a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or Enterprise subscription], you can also assign an event filter to a specific {endpoint-sec} integration policy, filtering endpoint events from only the hosts assigned to that policy.

IMPORTANT: Since an event filter blocks an event from streaming to {es}, be conscious of event filter conditions you set and any existing rule conditions. If there is too much overlap, the rule may run less frequently than specified and, therefore, will not trigger the corresponding alert for that rule. This is the expected behavior of event filters.

Create event filters from the Hosts page or the Event filters page.

. To create an event filter from the Hosts page:
.. Go to *Explore* -> *Hosts*.
.. Select the *Events* tab to view the Events table.
+
.. Find the event to create a filter, click the *More actions* button (*...*), then click *Add Endpoint event filter*.
+
TIP: Since you can only create filters for endpoint events, be sure to filter the Events table to display events generated by the {elastic-endpoint}. +
In the KQL search bar, enter the following query: `event.dataset : endpoint.events.network`.
+
.. Proceed to step 3.
. To create an event filter via the Event filters page:
.. Go to *Manage* -> *Event filters*.
.. Click *Add Event Filter*. The *Add event filter* flyout opens.

. Enter a name for the event filter.
. Depending on which page you add the filter, either modify the pre-populated conditions or add new conditions that define when {elastic-sec} filters events. You can define multiple conditions with `AND` relationships. You can also add nested conditions. In the image above, the event filter excludes events whose `event.category` field is `network`, and whose `process.executable` field is the same as the specified path.
. Select an option in the *Assignment* section to assign the event filter to a specific integration policy:
+
* `Global`: Assign the event filter to all integration policies for {endpoint-sec}.
* `Per Policy` (Platinum or Enterprise subscription only): Assign the event filter to one or more specific {endpoint-sec} integration policies. Select each policy in which you want the events to be filtered.
+
NOTE: You can also select the `Per Policy` option without assigning a policy to the event filter at this time. For example, you could do this if you want to create and review your event filter configurations before putting them into action with a policy.
. Add a new comment that describes or identifies the filter (optional).
. Click *Add event filter*. The new filter is added to the *Event filters* list.

== View and manage event filters

The **Event filters** list allows you to view and manage all endpoint event filters that have been added. To view the Event filters list, go to *Manage* -> *Event filters*. Event filters appear in reverse chronological order, with the most recently created filter at the top. Each filter has its own entry, which displays details such as the filter name, operating system, date created, and the filter conditions.

To refine the **Event filters** list, enter a query in the search bar. You can search the by name, comments, or the value of a field.
