= Host isolation

Host isolation allows you to isolate hosts from your network, blocking communication with other hosts on your network until you release the host. Isolating a host is useful for responding to malicious activity or preventing potential attacks, as it prevents lateral movement across other hosts. 

Isolated hosts, however, can still send data to {es} and {kib}. You can also create <<host-isolation-exceptions, host isolation exceptions>> for specific IP addresses that isolated hosts are still allowed to communicate with, even when blocked from the rest of your network.

Host isolation is a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or Enterprise subscription] feature. 

[NOTE] 
=========================
For {stack} version >= 7.15.0, host isolation is supported for endpoints running Windows, macOS, and these Linux distributions:

* CentOS/RHEL 8
* Ubuntu 18.04
* Ubuntu 20.04
* AWS Linux 2

To isolate and release hosts in any operating system, you must have the built-in `superuser` role. For more information, refer to {ref}/built-in-users.html[Built-in users].

You can isolate a host from an alert attached to a case or from the Endpoints list. Once a host is successfully isolated, an `Isolated` status displays next to the `Agent status` field, which you can view on the alert details flyout or Endpoints list table.

TIP: If the request fails, verify that the agent and your endpoint are both online before trying again.

All actions executed on a host are tracked in the host’s activity log, which you can access from the Endpoints page. See <<view-host-isolation-details, View host isolation details>> for more information.

== Isolate a host

To isolate a host from a case alert:

. Go to *Cases*, then select the appropriate case to view the case activity. Ensure you are viewing a case with at least one alert attached to it.
. Find the appropriate alert, then click the *Show alert details* button (*>*). The alert details flyout opens.
. Click *Take action -> Isolate host*.
. Enter a comment describing why you’re isolating the host (optional).
. Click *Confirm*.

To isolate a host from an endpoint:

. Go to *Manage -> Endpoints*, then either:
    * Select the appropriate endpoint in the *Endpoint* column, and click *Take action -> Isolate host* in the endpoint details flyout.
    * Click the *Actions* menu (*...*) on the appropriate endpoint, then select *Isolate host*.
. Enter a comment describing why you’re isolating the host (optional).
. Click *Confirm*.

After the host is successfully isolated, an *Isolated* status is added to the endpoint. Active end users receive a notification that the computer has been isolated from the network:

== View host isolation details

The host activity log tracks all actions performed on the host, including comments added, who made the host isolation request and when, and when the host received the request to isolate.

To view the host’s isolation details:

. Go to *Manage -> Endpoints*, then click the host's name in the *Endpoint* column. The endpoint details flyout opens.
