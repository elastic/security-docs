= Host isolation

Host isolation allows you to isolate hosts from your network, blocking communication with other hosts on your network until you release the host. Isolating a host is useful for responding to malicious activity or preventing potential attacks, as it prevents lateral movement across other hosts. 

Isolated hosts, however, can still send data to {es} and {kib}. You can also create <<host-isolation-exceptions, host isolation exceptions>> for specific IP addresses that isolated hosts are still allowed to communicate with, even when blocked from the rest of your network.

Host isolation is a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or Enterprise subscription] feature. 

[NOTE] 
=========================
For {stack} version >= 7.15.0, host isolation is supported for endpoints running Windows, macOS, and these Linux distributions:

* CentOS/RHEL 8
* Ubuntu 18.04
* Ubuntu 20.04
* AWS Linux 2

To isolate and release hosts in any operating system, you must have the built-in `superuser` role. For more information, refer to {ref}/built-in-users.html[Built-in users].

You can isolate a host from an alert attached to a case or from the Endpoints list. Once a host is successfully isolated, an `Isolated` status displays next to the `Agent status` field, which you can view on the alert details flyout or Endpoints list table.

TIP: If the request fails, verify that the agent and your endpoint are both online before trying again.

All actions executed on a host are tracked in the host’s actions log, which you can access from the Endpoints page. See <<view-host-isolation-details, View host isolation details>> for more information.
