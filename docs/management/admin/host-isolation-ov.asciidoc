= Host isolation

Host isolation allows you to isolate hosts from your network, blocking communication with other hosts on your network until you release the host. Isolating a host is useful for responding to malicious activity or preventing potential attacks, as it prevents lateral movement across other hosts. 

Isolated hosts, however, can still send data to {es} and {kib}. You can also create <<host-isolation-exceptions, host isolation exceptions>> for specific IP addresses that isolated hosts are still allowed to communicate with, even when blocked from the rest of your network.

* Host isolation is a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or Enterprise subscription] feature. 

* Hosts must have {agent} installed with the {elastic-defend} integration.

* For {stack} versions >= 7.15.0, host isolation is supported for endpoints running Windows, macOS, and these Linux distributions:

** CentOS/RHEL 8
** Debian 11
** Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, and 22.04
** AWS Linux 2

* To isolate and release hosts running any operating system, you must have the *Host Isolation* <<endpoint-management-req,privilege>>.

You can isolate a host from a detection alert's details flyout, from the Endpoints page, or (with an Enterprise subscription) from the endpoint response console. Once a host is successfully isolated, an `Isolated` status displays next to the `Agent status` field, which you can view on the alert details flyout or Endpoints list table.

TIP: If the request fails, verify that the {agent} and your endpoint are both online before trying again.

All actions executed on a host are tracked in the host’s response actions history, which you can access from the Endpoints page. Refer to <<view-host-isolation-details, View host isolation history>> for more information.

== Isolate a host

.Isolate a host from a detection alert
[%collapsible]
====
. Open a detection alert:
* From the Alerts table or Timeline: Click *View details* (image:images/view-details-icon.png[View details icon,16,15]).
* From a case with an attached alert: Click *Show alert details* (*>*).
. Click *Take action -> Isolate host*.
. Enter a comment describing why you’re isolating the host (optional).
. Click *Confirm*.
====

.Isolate a host from an endpoint
[%collapsible]
====
. Go to *Manage -> Endpoints*, then either:
    * Select the appropriate endpoint in the *Endpoint* column, and click *Take action -> Isolate host* in the endpoint details flyout.
    * Click the *Actions* menu (*...*) on the appropriate endpoint, then select *Isolate host*.
. Enter a comment describing why you’re isolating the host (optional).
. Click *Confirm*.

.Isolate a host from the response console
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: The response console is an https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Enterprise subscription] feature.

. Open the response console for the endpoint (*Manage* -> *Endpoints* -> *Actions* menu (*...*) -> *Respond*).
. Enter the `isolate` command and an optional comment in the input area, for example:
+
`isolate --comment "Isolate this host"`
. Press *Return*.
====

After the host is successfully isolated, an *Isolated* status is added to the endpoint. Active end users receive a notification that the computer has been isolated from the network:

== View host isolation history

To confirm if a host has been successfully isolated or released, check the response actions history, which logs the response actions performed on a host.

Go to *Manage* -> *Endpoints*, click an endpoint's name, then click the *Response action history* tab. You can filter the information displayed in this view. Refer to <<response-actions-history>> for more details.
