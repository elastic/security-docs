= Host isolation

Host isolation allows you to isolate hosts from your network, blocking communication with other hosts on your network until the host is released. Isolating a host is useful for responding to malicious activity or preventing potential attacks, as it prevents lateral movement across other hosts. Isolated hosts, however, can still send data to {es} and {kib}.

NOTE: For {stack} version >= 7.14.0, host isolation is supported for Windows and macOS endpoints only. To isolate and release hosts, you must have the built-in superuser role. For more information, see {ref}/built-in-users.html[Built-in users].

You can isolate a host via an alert attached to a case or from the Endpoints list. Once a host is successfully isolated, an `Isolated` status displays next to the `Agent status` field, which you can view on the alert details flyout or Endpoints list table.

TIP: If the request fails, verify that the agent and your endpoint are both online before trying again.

All actions executed on a host are tracked in the host’s activity log, which you can access from the Endpoints page. See <<view-host-isolation-details, View host isolation details>> for more information.
