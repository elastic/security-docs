= Endpoints
The Endpoints page allows admins to view and manage endpoints that are running the <<install-endpoint, {endpoint-cloud-sec} integration>>.

[NOTE]
=====
{fleet} must be enabled in a {kib} space for administrative actions to function correctly.

You must have the built-in `superuser` role to access this feature. For more information, refer to {ref}/built-in-users.html[Built-in users].

== Endpoints list

The *Endpoints* list displays all hosts running {elastic-sec} and their relevant integration details. Endpoints appear in chronological order, with newly added endpoints at the top. 

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/endpoints-pg.png[Endpoints page]

The Endpoints list provides the following data:

* *Endpoint*: The system hostname. Click the link to view host details in a flyout.

* *Agent Status*: The current status of the {agent}, which is one of the following:

** `Healthy`: The agent is online and communicating with {kib}.

** `Unenrolling`: The agent is currently unenrolling and will soon be removed from Fleet. Afterward, the endpoint will also uninstall.

** `Unhealthy`: The agent is online but requires attention from an admin because it's reporting a process being unhealthy. An unhealthy status could also mean an upgrade failed and was rolled back to its previous version.

** `Updating`: The agent is online and is updating the agent policy or binary, or is enrolling or unenrolling.

** `Offline`: The agent is still enrolled but may be on a machine that is shut down or currently does not have internet access. In this state, the agent is no longer communicating with {kib} at a regular interval.

NOTE: {agent} statuses in {fleet} correspond to the agent statuses in the {security-app}.

* *Policy*: The name of the associated policy when the agent was installed. Click the link to view the Integration policy page.

* *Policy status*: Lists whether the policy application was a success or failure. Click the link to view response details in a flyout.

* *OS*: The host's operating system.

* *IP address*: All IP addresses associated with the hostname.

* *Version*: The {stack} version currently running.

* *Last active*: A date and timestamp of the last time the {agent} was active.

* *Actions*: Select the context menu (*...*) to do the following:

** *Isolate host*: <<host-isolation-ov, Isolate the host>> from your network, blocking communication until the host is released.

** *Respond*: Open the <<response-actions,response console>> to perform response actions directly on the host.

** *View actions log*: View a history of response actions performed on the host.

** *View host details*: View host details on the *Hosts* page in the {security-app}.

** *View agent policy*: View the agent policy in {fleet}.

** *View agent details*: View {agent} details and activity logs in {fleet}.

** *Reassign agent policy*: Change the {fleet-guide}/agent-policy.html#apply-a-policy[agent policy] assigned to the host in {fleet}.

=== Endpoint details

Click any link in the *Endpoint* column to display host details in a flyout. You can also use the *Take Action* menu button to perform the same actions as those listed in the Actions context menu, such as isolating the host, viewing host details, and viewing or reassigning the agent policy.

=== Integration policy details

To view the integration policy page, click the link in the *Policy* column. If you are viewing host details, you can also click the *Policy* link on the flyout.

On this page, you can view and configure endpoint protection and event collection settings. In the upper-right corner are Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that provide current endpoint status. If you need to update the policy, make changes as appropriate, then click the *Save* button to apply the new changes.

NOTE: Users must have permission to read/write to {fleet} APIs to make changes to the configuration.

Users who have unique configuration and security requirements can select **Show advanced settings** to configure the policy to support advanced use cases. Hover over each setting to view its description.

NOTE: Advanced settings are not recommended for most users.

=== Policy status

The status of the policy application appears in the *Status* column and displays one of the following possibilities:

* `Success`: The policy was applied successfully.

* `Warning or Partially Applied`: The policy is pending application, or the policy was not applied in its entirety.

NOTE: In some cases, some actions taken on the endpoint may fail during the policy application but are not recognized as a critical failure - meaning there may be a failure, but the endpoints are still protected. In this case, the policy status will display as "Partially Applied."

* `Failure`: The policy did not apply correctly. As such, endpoints are not protected.

* `Unknown`: The user interface is waiting for the API response to return, or, in rare cases, the API returns an undefined error or value.

To view policy status details, click the link and review the data in the flyout that displays.

=== Filter endpoints

To filter the Endpoints list, use the search bar to enter a query using *{kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language (KQL)]*. To refresh the search results, click *Refresh*.

NOTE: The date and time picker on the right side of the page allows you to set a time interval to automatically refresh the Endpoints list — for example, to check if new endpoints were added or deleted.
