= Endpoints
The Endpoints page allows administrators to view and manage endpoints that are running the <<install-endpoint, {endpoint-cloud-sec} integration>>.

[NOTE]
=====
{fleet} must be enabled in a {kib} space for administrative actions to function correctly.

You must have the built-in `superuser` role to access this feature. For more information, refer to {ref}/built-in-users.html[Built-in users].

== Endpoints list

The *Endpoints* list displays all hosts running {elastic-sec} and their relevant integration details. Endpoints appear in chronological order, with newly added endpoints at the top.

image::images/endpoints-pg.png[Endpoints page]

The Endpoints list provides the following data:

* *Endpoint*: The system hostname. Click the link to display <<endpoint-details,endpoint details>> in a flyout.

* *Agent Status*: The current status of the {agent}, which is one of the following:

** `Healthy`: The agent is online and communicating with {kib}.

** `Unenrolling`: The agent is currently unenrolling and will soon be removed from Fleet. Afterward, the endpoint will also uninstall.

** `Unhealthy`: The agent is online but requires attention from an administrator because it's reporting a problem with a process. An unhealthy status could mean an upgrade failed and was rolled back to its previous version, or an integration might be missing prerequisites or additional configuration. Refer to <<ts-unhealthy-agent,Endpoint management troubleshooting>> for more on resolving an unhealthy agent status.

** `Updating`: The agent is online and is updating the agent policy or binary, or is enrolling or unenrolling.

** `Offline`: The agent is still enrolled but may be on a machine that is shut down or currently does not have internet access. In this state, the agent is no longer communicating with {kib} at a regular interval.
+
NOTE: {agent} statuses in {fleet} correspond to the agent statuses in the {security-app}.

* *Policy:* The name of the associated integration policy when the agent was installed. Click the link to display the <<integration-policy-details,integration policy details>> page.

* *Policy status:* Indicates whether the integration policy was successfully applied. Click the link to view <<policy-status,policy status>> response details in a flyout.

* *OS*: The host's operating system.

* *IP address*: All IP addresses associated with the hostname.

* *Version*: The {stack} version currently running.

* *Last active*: A date and timestamp of the last time the {agent} was active.

* *Actions*: Select the context menu (*...*) to do the following:

** *Isolate host*: <<host-isolation-ov, Isolate the host>> from your network, blocking communication until the host is released.

** *Respond*: Open the <<response-actions,response console>> to perform response actions directly on the host.

** *View actions log*: View a history of response actions performed on the host.

** *View host details*: View host details on the *Hosts* page in the {security-app}.

** *View agent policy*: View the agent policy in {fleet}.

** *View agent details*: View {agent} details and activity logs in {fleet}.

** *Reassign agent policy*: Change the {fleet-guide}/agent-policy.html#apply-a-policy[agent policy] assigned to the host in {fleet}.

[[endpoint-details]]
=== Endpoint details

Click any link in the *Endpoint* column to display host details in a flyout. You can also use the *Take Action* menu button to perform the same actions as those listed in the Actions context menu, such as isolating the host, viewing host details, and viewing or reassigning the agent policy.

[[integration-policy-details]]
=== Integration policy details

To view the integration policy page, click the link in the *Policy* column. If you are viewing host details, you can also click the *Policy* link on the flyout.

On this page, you can view and configure endpoint protection and event collection settings. In the upper-right corner are Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that provide current endpoint status. If you need to update the policy, make changes as appropriate, then click the *Save* button to apply the new changes.

NOTE: Users must have permission to read/write to {fleet} APIs to make changes to the configuration.

Users who have unique configuration and security requirements can select **Show advanced settings** to configure the policy to support advanced use cases. Hover over each setting to view its description.

NOTE: Advanced settings are not recommended for most users.

[[policy-status]]
=== Policy status

The status of the integration policy appears in the *Policy status* column and displays one of the following:

* `Success`: The policy was applied successfully.

* `Warning` or `Partially Applied`: The policy is pending application, or the policy was not applied in its entirety.
+
NOTE: In some cases, actions taken on the endpoint may fail during policy application, but these cases are not critical failures - meaning there may be a failure, but the endpoints are still protected. In this case, the policy status will display as "Partially Applied."

* `Failure`: The policy did not apply correctly, and endpoints are not protected.

* `Unknown`: The user interface is waiting for the API response to return, or, in rare cases, the API returned an undefined error or value.

For more details on what's causing a policy status, click the link in the *Policy status* column and review the details flyout. Expand each section and subsection to display individual responses from the agent.

TIP: If you need help troubleshooting a configuration failure, refer to <<ts-unhealthy-agent,Endpoint management troubleshooting>> and {fleet-guide}/fleet-troubleshooting.html[{fleet} troubleshooting].

NOTE: The date and time picker on the right side of the page allows you to set a time interval to automatically refresh the Endpoints list â€” for example, to check if new endpoints were added or deleted.
