== SentinelOne response actions

You can direct SentinelOne to perform response actions on protected hosts without leaving the {elastic-sec} UI. Prior <<response-actions-config,configuration>> is required to connect {elastic-sec} with SentinelOne.

The following response actions and related features are supported for SentinelOne-protected hosts:

* **Isolate and release a host** using any of these methods:

--
** From a detection alert
** From the response console

Refer to the instructions on <<isolate-a-host,isolating>> and <<release-a-host,releasing>> hosts for more details.
