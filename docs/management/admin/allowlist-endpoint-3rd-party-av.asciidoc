[[allowlist-endpoint-3rd-party-av-apps]]
= Allowlist {elastic-endpoint} in third-party antivirus apps

NOTE: If you use other antivirus (AV) software along with {elastic-defend}, you may need to add the other system as a trusted application in the {security-app}. Refer to <<trusted-apps-ov>> for more information.

Third-party antivirus (AV) applications may identify the expected behavior of {elastic-endpoint}—the installed component that performs {elastic-defend}'s threat monitoring and prevention—as a potential threat. Add {elastic-endpoint}'s digital signatures and file paths to your AV software's allowlist to ensure {elastic-endpoint} continues to function as intended. We recommend you allowlist both the file paths and digital signatures, if applicable. 

NOTE: Your AV software may refer to allowlisted processes as process exclusions, ignored processes, or trusted processes. It is important to note that file, folder, and path-based exclusions/exceptions are distinct from trusted applications and will not achieve the same result. This page explains how to ignore actions taken by processes, not how to ignore the files that spawned those processes.
