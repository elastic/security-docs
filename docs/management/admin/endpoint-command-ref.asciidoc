[[endpoint-command-ref]]
= {elastic-endpoint} command reference

This page lists the commands for management and troubleshooting of {elastic-endpoint}, the installed component that performs {elastic-defend}'s threat monitoring and prevention.

[NOTE]
====
* {elastic-endpoint} is not added to the `PATH` system variable, so you must prepend the commands with the full OS-dependent path:
** On Windows: `"C:\Program Files\Elastic\Endpoint\elastic-endpoint.exe"`
** On macOS: `/Library/Elastic/Endpoint/elastic-endpoint`
** On Linux: `/opt/Elastic/Endpoint/elastic-endpoint`

* You must run the commands with elevated privilegesâ€”using `sudo` to run as the root user on Linux and macOS, or running as Administrator on Windows.
====

The following {elastic-endpoint} commands are available:

* <<elastic-endpoint-diagnostics-command, diagnostics>>
* <<elastic-endpoint-help-command, help>>
* <<elastic-endpoint-inspect-command, inspect>>
* <<elastic-endpoint-install-command, install>>
* <<elastic-endpoint-memorydump-command, memorydump>>
* <<elastic-endpoint-run-command, run>>
* <<elastic-endpoint-send-command, send>>
* <<elastic-endpoint-status-command, status>>
* <<elastic-endpoint-test-command, test>>
* <<elastic-endpoint-top-command, top>>
* <<elastic-endpoint-uninstall-command, uninstall>>
* <<elastic-endpoint-version-command, version>>

Each of the commands accepts the following logging options:

* `--log [stdout,stderr,debugview,file]`
* `--log-level [error,info,debug]`

[discrete]
[[elastic-endpoint-diagnostics-command]]
== elastic-endpoint diagnostics

Gather diagnostics information from {elastic-endpoint}. This command produces an archive that contains:

- `version.txt`: Version information
- `elastic-endpoint.yaml`: Current policy
- `metrics.json`: Metrics document
- `policy_response.json`: Last policy response
- `system_info.txt`: System information
- `analysis.txt`: Diagnostic analysis report
- `logs` directory: Copy of {elastic-endpoint} log files

[source,shell]
------
elastic-endpoint diagnostics
------

[discrete]
[[elastic-endpoint-help-command]]
== elastic-endpoint help

Show help for the available commands.

[discrete]
=== Example

[source,shell]
------
elastic-endpoint help
------

[discrete]
[[elastic-endpoint-inspect-command]]
== elastic-endpoint inspect

Show the current {elastic-endpoint} configuration.

[discrete]
=== Example

[source,shell]
------
elastic-endpoint inspect
------

[discrete]
[[elastic-endpoint-install-command]]
== elastic-endpoint install

Install {elastic-endpoint} as a system service.

NOTE: We do not recommend installing {elastic-endpoint} using this command. {elastic-endpoint} is managed by {agent} and cannot function as a standalone service. Therefore, there is no separate installation package for {elastic-endpoint}, and it should not be installed independently.

[discrete]
=== Options

`--resources <string>`::
Specify a resources `.zip` file to be used during the installation. This option is required.

`--upgrade`::
Upgrade the existing installation.

[discrete]
=== Example

[source,shell]
------
elastic-endpoint install --upgrade --resources endpoint-security-resources.zip
------

[discrete]
[[elastic-endpoint-memorydump-command]]
== elastic-endpoint memorydump

Save a memory dump of the {elastic-endpoint} service.

[discrete]
=== Options

`--compress`::
Compress the saved memory dump.

`--timeout <duration>`::
Specify the memory collection timeout, in seconds; the default is 60 seconds.

[discrete]
=== Example

[source,shell]
------
elastic-endpoint memorydump --timeout 120
------

[discrete]
[[elastic-endpoint-run-command]]
== elastic-endpoint run

Run `elastic-endpoint` as a foreground process if no other instance is already running.

[discrete]
=== Example

[source,shell]
------
elastic-endpoint run
------

[discrete]
[[elastic-endpoint-send-command]]
== elastic-endpoint send

Send the requested document to the {stack}.

[discrete]
=== Subcommands

`metadata`::
Send an off-schedule metrics document to the {stack}.

[discrete]
=== Example

[source,shell]
------
elastic-endpoint send metadata
------

[discrete]
[[elastic-endpoint-status-command]]
== elastic-endpoint status

Retrieve the current status of the running {elastic-endpoint} service. The command also returns the last known status of {agent}.

[discrete]
=== Options

`--output`::
Control the level of detail and formatting of the information. Valid values are:

* `human`: Returns limited information when {elastic-endpoint}'s status is `Healthy`. If any policy actions weren't successfully applied, the relevant details are displayed.
* `full`: Always returns the full status information.
* `json`: Always returns the full status information.

[discrete]
=== Example

[source,shell]
------
elastic-endpoint status --output json
------

[discrete]
[[elastic-endpoint-test-command]]
== elastic-endpoint test

Perform the requested test.

[discrete]
=== Subcommands

`output`::
Test whether {elastic-endpoint} can connect to remote resources.

[discrete]
=== Example

[source,shell]
------
elastic-endpoint test output
------

[discrete]
=== Example output

[source,txt]
----
Testing output connections

Using proxy:

Elasticsearch server: https://example.elastic.co:443
        Status: Success

Global artifact server: https://artifacts.security.elastic.co
        Status: Success

Fleet server: https://fleet.example.elastic.co:443
        Status: Success
----

[discrete]
[[elastic-endpoint-top-command]]
== elastic-endpoint top

Show a breakdown of the executables that triggered {elastic-endpoint} CPU usage within the last interval. This displays which {elastic-endpoint} features are resource-intensive for a particular executable.

NOTE: The meaning and output of this command are similar, but not identical, to the POSIX `top` command. The `elastic-endpoint top` command aggregates multiple processes by executable. The utilization values aren't measured by the OS scheduler but by a wall clock in user mode. The output helps identify outliers causing excessive CPU utilization, allowing you to fine-tune the {elastic-defend} policy and exception lists in your deployment.

[discrete]
=== Options

`--interval <duration>`::
Specify the data collection interval, in seconds; the default is 5 seconds.

`--limit <number>`::
Specify the number of updates to collect; by default, data is collected until interrupted by **Ctrl+C**.

`--normalized`::
Normalize CPU usage values to a total of 100% across all CPUs on multi-CPU systems.

[discrete]
=== Example

[source,shell]
------
elastic-endpoint top --interval 10 --limit 5
------

[discrete]

[[elastic-endpoint-uninstall-command]]
== elastic-endpoint uninstall

Uninstall {elastic-endpoint}.

NOTE: {elastic-endpoint} is managed by {agent}. To remove {elastic-endpoint} from the target machine permanently, remove the {elastic-defend} integration from the {fleet} policy. The <<uninstall-agent,elastic-agent uninstall>> command also uninstalls {elastic-endpoint}; therefore, in practice, the `elastic-endpoint uninstall` command is used only to troubleshoot broken installations.

[discrete]
=== Options

`--uninstall-token <string>`::
Provide the uninstall token. The token is required if <<agent-tamper-protection,agent tamper protection>> is enabled.

[discrete]
=== Example

[source,shell]
------
elastic-endpoint uninstall --uninstall-token 12345678901234567890123456789012
------

[discrete]
[[elastic-endpoint-version-command]]
== elastic-endpoint version

Show the version of {elastic-endpoint}.

[discrete]
=== Example

[source,shell]
------
elastic-endpoint version
------
