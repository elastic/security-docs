== Endpoint management API

The following APIs allow you to interact with and manage endpoints running the {endpoint-sec} integration.

NOTE: Console now supports sending requests to {kib} APIs: prepend any {kib} API endpoint with `kbn:` and send the request via Console, for example, `GET kbn:/api/index_management/indices`.
