== Endpoint management API

The following APIs allow you to interact with and manage endpoints running the {endpoint-sec} integration.

NOTE: Console supports Elasticsearch APIs only. Console doesn't allow interactions with {kib} APIs. You must use `curl` or another HTTP tool instead. For more information, refer to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/console-kibana.html[Run Elasticsearch API requests].
