[[execute-api]]
=== Execute a command on a host

Execute a command on a host running {elastic-defend}.

You must have the `Execute Operations` {kib} privilege in the Security feature as part of your role and an Enterprise license to perform this action.

==== Request URL

`POST <kibana host>:<port>/api/endpoint/action/execute`

==== Request body

A JSON object with these fields:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
include::_response-actions-api-reusable-content.asciidoc[tags=create-response-actions-api-common-body-options-row-content]

|`parameters.command` |String |A shell command to run on the host. The command must be supported by `bash` for Linux and macOS hosts, and `cmd.exe` for Windows. |Yes
|`parameters.timeout` |Integer |The duration, in seconds, that the host waits for the command to complete. If no timeout is specified, it defaults to four hours. |No

|==============================================


NOTE: The `execute` action uploads a text file containing the results of the execution on the endpoint, which is rate-limited.  If you are using the `endpoint_ids` field to task multiple endpoints, you should batch your calls in groups of 10 at a time.
