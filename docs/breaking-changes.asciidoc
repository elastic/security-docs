== 7.9 Release

[discrete]
=== Actions API

When you <<register-connector, create a {sn} connector>> via the Actions API:

* The `casesConfiguration` object is deprecated. Instead, use
`incidentConfiguration`.
* To see {sn} connectors in the UI, you must use the `isCaseOwned` field.

The `casesConfiguration` object will be removed in a future release. 

IMPORTANT: These changes only apply to {sn} connectors.
