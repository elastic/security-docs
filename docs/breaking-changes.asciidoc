=== Actions API

When you <<register-connector, create a {sn} connector>> via the Actions API:

* The `casesConfiguration` object is obsolete. Instead, use
`incidentConfiguration`.
* To see {sn} connectors in the UI, you must use the `isCaseOwned` field.

IMPORTANT: These changes only apply to {sn} connectors.
