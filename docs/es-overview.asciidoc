= Elastic Security overview

Elastic Security combines SIEM threat detection features with endpoint
prevention and response capabilities in one solution. These analytical and
protection capabilities, leveraged by the speed and extensibility of
Elasticsearch, enable analysts to defend their organization from threats before
damage and loss occur.

Elastic Security provides the following security benefits and capabilities:

* A detection engine to identify attacks and system misconfigurations
* A workspace for event triage and investigations
* Interactive visualizations to investigate process relationships
* Inbuilt case management with automated actions
* Detection of signatureless attacks with prebuilt machine learning anomaly jobs
and detection rules

== Elastic Security components and workflow

The following diagram provides a comprehensive illustration of the Elastic Security workflow.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/workflow.png[Elastic Security workflow]

Here's an overview of the flow and its components:

* Data is shipped from your hosts to {es} via beat modules and the Elastic
Endpoint Security agent integration:
** <<install-endpoint, {es-sec-endpoint}>> - Elastic agent integration that
protects your hosts <<malware-prevention, against malware>> and ships these data sets:
***  *Windows*: Process, network, file, DNS, registry, DLL and driver loads,
malware security detections
*** *Linux/macOS*: Process, network, file
** https://www.elastic.co/integrations?solution=security[Beat modules]: {beats}
are lightweight data shippers. Beat modules provide a way of collecting and
parsing specific data sets from common sources, such as cloud and OS events,
logs, and metrics. Common security-related modules are listed
<<enable-beat-modules, here>>.
* The {security-app} in {kib} is used to manage the *Detection engine*,
*Cases*, and *Timeline*, as well as administer hosts running Endpoint Security:
** Detection engine - Automatically searches for suspicious host and network
activity via:
*** <<detection-engine-overview, Detection rules>>: Periodically search the data
({es} indices) sent from your hosts for suspicious events. When a suspicious
event is discovered, a detection alert is generated. External systems, such as
Slack and email, can be used to send notifications when alerts are generated.
You can create your own rules and make use of our <<prebuilt-rules, prebuilt ones>>.
*** <<detections-ui-exceptions, Exceptions>>: Reduce noise and the number of
false positives. Exceptions are associated with rules and prevent alerts when
an exception's conditions are met. *Value lists* contain source event
values that can be used as part of an exception's conditions. When
{es-sec-endpoint} is installed on your hosts, you can add malware exceptions
directly to the endpoint from the Security app.
*** <<included-jobs, {ml-cap} jobs>>: Automatic anomaly detection of host and
network events. Anomaly scores are provided per host, and can be used with
detection rules.
** <<timelines-ui, Timeline>>: Workspace for investigating alerts and events.
Timelines use queries and filters to drill down into events related to
a specific incident. Timeline templates are attached to rules and use predefined
queries when alerts are investigated. Timelines can be saved and shared with
others, as well as attached to Cases.
** <<cases-overview, Cases>>: Internal system for opening, tracking, and sharing
security issues directly in the Security app. Cases can be integrated with
external ticketing systems.
** <<admin-page-ov, Administration>>: View and manage hosts running {es-sec-endpoint}.

<<ingest-data>> and <<install-endpoint>> describe how to ship security-related
data to {es}.


For more background information, see:

* https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[{es}]: A real-time,
distributed storage, search, and analytics engine. {es} excels at indexing
streams of semi-structured data, such as logs or metrics.
* https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana[{kib}]: An open source analytics and
visualization platform designed to work with {es}. You use {kib} to search,
view, and interact with data stored in {es} indices. You can easily perform
advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables,
and maps.

=== Additional Elastic Endpoint Security information

The Elastic https://www.elastic.co/endpoint-security/[Endpoint Security agent integration]
provides capabilities such as collecting events, detecting and preventing
malicious activity, exceptions, and artifact delivery. The
{fleet-guide}/fleet-overview.html[{fleet}] is used to
install and manage Elastic agents and integrations on your hosts.

=== Integration with other Elastic products

You can use {es-sec} with other Elastic products and features to help you
identify and investigate suspicious activity:

* https://www.elastic.co/products/stack/machine-learning[{ml-cap}]
* https://www.elastic.co/products/stack/alerting[Alerting]
* https://www.elastic.co/products/stack/canvas[Canvas]

[[data-sources]]
=== APM transaction data sources

By default, {es-sec} monitors {apm-app-ref}/apm-getting-started.html[APM]
`apm-*-transaction*` indices. To add additional APM indices, update the
index patterns in the `securitySolution:defaultIndex` setting ({kib} -> Stack Management -> Advanced Settings -> `securitySolution:defaultIndex`).

[discrete]
=== Third-party collectors mapped to ECS

The {ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)] defines a common set of fields to be used for
storing event data in Elasticsearch. ECS helps users normalize their event data
to better analyze, visualize, and correlate the data represented in their
events. {es-sec} can ingest and normalize events from any ECS-compliant data source.

IMPORTANT: {es-sec} requires {ecs-ref}[ECS-compliant data]. If you use third-party data collectors to ship data to {es}, the data must be mapped to ECS.
<<siem-field-reference>> lists ECS fields used in {es-sec}.
