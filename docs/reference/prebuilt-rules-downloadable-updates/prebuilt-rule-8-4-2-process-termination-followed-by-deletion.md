# Process Termination followed by Deletion [prebuilt-rule-8-4-2-process-termination-followed-by-deletion]

Identifies a process termination event quickly followed by the deletion of its executable file. Malware tools and other non-native files dropped or created on a system by an adversary may leave traces to indicate to what occurred. Removal of these files can occur during an intrusion, or as part of a post-intrusion process to minimize the adversaryâ€™s footprint.
