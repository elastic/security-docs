# Elastic Agent Service Terminated [prebuilt-rule-8-1-1-elastic-agent-service-terminated]

Identifies the Elastic endpoint agent has stopped and is no longer running on the host. Adversaries may attempt to disable security monitoring tools in an attempt to evade detection or prevention capabilities during an intrusion. This may also indicate an issue with the agent itself and should be addressed to ensure defensive measures are back in a stable state.

## Investigation guide [_investigation_guide_1679]

## Config

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

## Rule query [_rule_query_1948]

```js
process where
/* net, sc or wmic stopping or deleting Elastic Agent on Windows */
(event.type == "start" and
  process.name : ("net.exe", "sc.exe", "wmic.exe","powershell.exe","taskkill.exe","PsKill.exe","ProcessHacker.exe") and
  process.args : ("stopservice","uninstall", "stop", "disabled","Stop-Process","terminate","suspend") and
  process.args : ("elasticendpoint", "Elastic Agent","elastic-agent","elastic-endpoint"))
or
/* service or systemctl used to stop Elastic Agent on Linux */
(event.type == "end" and
  (process.name : ("systemctl","service") and
    process.args : ("elastic-agent", "stop"))
  or
  /* Unload Elastic Agent extension on MacOS */
  (process.name : "kextunload" and
    process.args : "com.apple.iokit.EndpointSecurity" and
    event.action : "end"))
```
