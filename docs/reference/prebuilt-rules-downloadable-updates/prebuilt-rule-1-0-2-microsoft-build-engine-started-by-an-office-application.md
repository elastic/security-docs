# Microsoft Build Engine Started by an Office Application [prebuilt-rule-1-0-2-microsoft-build-engine-started-by-an-office-application]

An instance of the Microsoft Build Engine (MSBuild) was started by Excel or Word. This is unusual behavior for MSBuild and could have been caused by an Excel or Word document executing a malicious script payload.

## Investigation guide [_investigation_guide_1544]

## Config

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

## Rule query [_rule_query_1782]

```js
process where event.type in ("start", "process_started") and
  process.name : "MSBuild.exe" and
  process.parent.name : ("eqnedt32.exe",
                         "excel.exe",
                         "fltldr.exe",
                         "msaccess.exe",
                         "mspub.exe",
                         "outlook.exe",
                         "powerpnt.exe",
                         "winword.exe" )
```
