# GitHub Protected Branch Settings Changed [prebuilt-rule-8-17-1-github-protected-branch-settings-changed]

This rule detects setting modifications for protected branches of a GitHub repository. Branch protection rules can be used to enforce certain workflows or requirements before a contributor can push changes to a branch in your repository. Changes to these protected branch settings should be investigated and verified as legitimate activity. Unauthorized changes could be used to lower your organizationâ€™s security posture and leave you exposed for future attacks.
