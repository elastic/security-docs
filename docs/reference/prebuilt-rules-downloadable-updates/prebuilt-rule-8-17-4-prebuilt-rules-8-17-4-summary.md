| [AWS IAM Roles Anywhere Profile Creation](/reference/prebuilt-rules-downloadable-updates/prebuilt-rule-8-17-4-aws-iam-roles-anywhere-profile-creation.md) | Identifies the creation of an AWS Roles Anywhere profile. AWS Roles Anywhere is a feature that allows you to use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) profiles to manage access to your AWS resources from any location via trusted anchors. This rule detects the creation of a profile that can be assumed from any service. Adversaries may create profiles tied to overly permissive roles to maintain access to AWS resources. Ensure that the profile creation is expected and that the trust policy is configured securely. | update | 3 |
| [AWS IAM Roles Anywhere Trust Anchor Created with External CA](/reference/prebuilt-rules-downloadable-updates/prebuilt-rule-8-17-4-aws-iam-roles-anywhere-trust-anchor-created-with-external-ca.md) | Identifies when an AWS IAM Roles Anywhere Trust Anchor with an external certificate authority is created. AWS Roles Anywhere profiles are legitimate profiles that can be created by administrators to allow access from any location. This rule detects when a trust anchor is created with an external certificate authority that is not managed by AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority (ACM PCA). Adversaries may accomplish this to maintain persistence in the environment. | update | 3 |
| [AWS IAM User Created Access Keys For Another User](/reference/prebuilt-rules-downloadable-updates/prebuilt-rule-8-17-4-aws-iam-user-created-access-keys-for-another-user.md) | An adversary with access to a set of compromised credentials may attempt to persist or escalate privileges by creating a new set of credentials for an existing user. This rule looks for use of the IAM `CreateAccessKey` API operation to create new programmatic access keys for another IAM user. | update | 6 |
| [AWS Lambda Function Policy Updated to Allow Public Invocation](/reference/prebuilt-rules-downloadable-updates/prebuilt-rule-8-17-4-aws-lambda-function-policy-updated-to-allow-public-invocation.md) | Identifies when an AWS Lambda function policy is updated to allow public invocation. This rule specifically looks for the `AddPermission` API call with the `Principal` set to `*` which allows any AWS account to invoke the Lambda function. Adversaries may abuse this permission to create a backdoor in the Lambda function that allows them to execute arbitrary code. | update | 2 |
| [AWS RDS Cluster Creation](/reference/prebuilt-rules-downloadable-updates/prebuilt-rule-8-17-4-aws-rds-cluster-creation.md) | Identifies the creation of a new Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) Aurora DB cluster or global database spread across multiple regions. | update | 207 |
| [AWS RDS DB Instance or Cluster Password Modified](/reference/prebuilt-rules-downloadable-updates/prebuilt-rule-8-17-4-aws-rds-db-instance-or-cluster-password-modified.md) | Identifies the modification of the master password for an AWS RDS DB instance or cluster. DB instances may contain sensitive data that can be abused if accessed by unauthorized actors. Amazon RDS API operations never return the password, so this operation provides a means to regain access if the password is lost. Adversaries with the proper permissions can take advantage of this to evade defenses and gain unauthorized access to a DB instance or cluster to support persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation. | update | 3 |
| [AWS RDS Security Group Creation](/reference/prebuilt-rules-downloadable-updates/prebuilt-rule-8-17-4-aws-rds-security-group-creation.md) | Identifies the creation of an Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) Security group. | update | 207 |

| [Kubernetes Exposed Service Created With Type NodePort](/reference/prebuilt-rules-downloadable-updates/prebuilt-rule-8-17-4-kubernetes-exposed-service-created-with-type-nodeport.md) | This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a service as type NodePort. The NodePort service allows a user to externally expose a set of labeled pods to the internet. This creates an open port on every worker node in the cluster that has a pod for that service. When external traffic is received on that open port, it directs it to the specific pod through the service representing it. A malicious user can configure a service as type Nodeport in order to intercept traffic from other pods or nodes, bypassing firewalls and other network security measures configured for load balancers within a cluster. This creates a direct method of communication between the cluster and the outside world, which could be used for more malicious behavior and certainly widens the attack surface of your cluster. | update | 204 |
| [Kubernetes Container Created with Excessive Linux Capabilities](/reference/prebuilt-rules-downloadable-updates/prebuilt-rule-8-17-4-kubernetes-container-created-with-excessive-linux-capabilities.md) | This rule detects a container deployed with one or more dangerously permissive Linux capabilities. An attacker with the ability to deploy a container with added capabilities could use this for further execution, lateral movement, or privilege escalation within a cluster. The capabilities detected in this rule have been used in container escapes to the host machine. | update | 6 |
| [Kubernetes Pod Created With HostIPC](/reference/prebuilt-rules-downloadable-updates/prebuilt-rule-8-17-4-kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostipc.md) | This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a pod using the host IPC namespace. This gives access to data used by any pod that also use the hosts IPC namespace. If any process on the host or any processes in a pod uses the hosts inter-process communication mechanisms (shared memory, semaphore arrays, message queues, etc.), an attacker can read/write to those same mechanisms. They may look for files in /dev/shm or use ipcs to check for any IPC facilities being used. | update | 205 |
| [Kubernetes Pod Created With HostNetwork](/reference/prebuilt-rules-downloadable-updates/prebuilt-rule-8-17-4-kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostnetwork.md) | This rules detects an attempt to create or modify a pod attached to the host network. HostNetwork allows a pod to use the node network namespace. Doing so gives the pod access to any service running on localhost of the host. An attacker could use this access to snoop on network activity of other pods on the same node or bypass restrictive network policies applied to its given namespace. | update | 205 |
| [Kubernetes Pod Created With HostPID](/reference/prebuilt-rules-downloadable-updates/prebuilt-rule-8-17-4-kubernetes-pod-created-with-hostpid.md) | This rule detects an attempt to create or modify a pod attached to the host PID namespace. HostPID allows a pod to access all the processes running on the host and could allow an attacker to take malicious action. When paired with ptrace this can be used to escalate privileges outside of the container. When paired with a privileged container, the pod can see all of the processes on the host. An attacker can enter the init system (PID 1) on the host. From there, they could execute a shell and continue to escalate privileges to root. | update | 205 |
| [Kubernetes Pod created with a Sensitive hostPath Volume](/reference/prebuilt-rules-downloadable-updates/prebuilt-rule-8-17-4-kubernetes-pod-created-with-a-sensitive-hostpath-volume.md) | This rule detects when a pod is created with a sensitive volume of type hostPath. A hostPath volume type mounts a sensitive file or folder from the node to the container. If the container gets compromised, the attacker can use this mount for gaining access to the node. There are many ways a container with unrestricted access to the host filesystem can escalate privileges, including reading data from other containers, and accessing tokens of more privileged pods. | update | 205 |
| [Kubernetes Privileged Pod Created](/reference/prebuilt-rules-downloadable-updates/prebuilt-rule-8-17-4-kubernetes-privileged-pod-created.md) | This rule detects when a user creates a pod/container running in privileged mode. A highly privileged container has access to the node’s resources and breaks the isolation between containers. If compromised, an attacker can use the privileged container to gain access to the underlying host. Gaining access to the host may provide the adversary with the opportunity to achieve follow-on objectives, such as establishing persistence, moving laterally within the environment, or setting up a command and control channel on the host. | update | 205 |
| [Kubernetes Suspicious Assignment of Controller Service Account](/reference/prebuilt-rules-downloadable-updates/prebuilt-rule-8-17-4-kubernetes-suspicious-assignment-of-controller-service-account.md) | This rule detects a request to attach a controller service account to an existing or new pod running in the kube-system namespace. By default, controllers running as part of the API Server utilize admin-equivalent service accounts hosted in the kube-system namespace. Controller service accounts aren’t normally assigned to running pods and could indicate adversary behavior within the cluster. An attacker that can create or modify pods or pod controllers in the kube-system namespace, can assign one of these admin-equivalent service accounts to a pod and abuse their powerful token to escalate privileges and gain complete cluster control. | update | 7 |
| [High Mean of Process Arguments in an RDP Session](/reference/prebuilt-rules-downloadable-updates/prebuilt-rule-8-17-4-high-mean-of-process-arguments-in-an-rdp-session.md) | A machine learning job has detected unusually high number of process arguments in an RDP session.

| [Unusual Web Request](/reference/prebuilt-rules-downloadable-updates/prebuilt-rule-8-17-4-unusual-web-request.md) | A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual URL that indicates unusual web browsing activity. This can be due to initial access, persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. For example, in a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack, when a trusted website is compromised to target a particular sector or organization, targeted users may receive emails with uncommon URLs for trusted websites. These URLs can be used to download and run a payload. When malware is already running, it may send requests to uncommon URLs on trusted websites the malware uses for command-and-control communication. When rare URLs are observed being requested for a local web server by a remote source, these can be due to web scanning, enumeration or attack traffic, or they can be due to bots and web scrapers which are part of common Internet background traffic. | update | 105 |
| [Unusual Web User Agent](/reference/prebuilt-rules-downloadable-updates/prebuilt-rule-8-17-4-unusual-web-user-agent.md) | A machine learning job detected a rare and unusual user agent indicating web browsing activity by an unusual process other than a web browser. This can be due to persistence, command-and-control, or exfiltration activity. Uncommon user agents coming from remote sources to local destinations are often the result of scanners, bots, and web scrapers, which are part of common Internet background traffic. Much of this is noise, but more targeted attacks on websites using tools like Burp or SQLmap can sometimes be discovered by spotting uncommon user agents. Uncommon user agents in traffic from local sources to remote destinations can be any number of things, including harmless programs like weather monitoring or stock-trading programs. However, uncommon user agents from local sources can also be due to malware or scanning activity. | update | 105 |
