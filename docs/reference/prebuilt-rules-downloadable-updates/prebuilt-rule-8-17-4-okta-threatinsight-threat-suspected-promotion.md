# Okta ThreatInsight Threat Suspected Promotion [prebuilt-rule-8-17-4-okta-threatinsight-threat-suspected-promotion]

Okta ThreatInsight is a feature that provides valuable debug data regarding authentication and authorization processes, which is logged in the system. Within this data, there is a specific field called threat_suspected, which represents Oktaâ€™s internal evaluation of the authentication or authorization workflow. When this field is set to True, it suggests the presence of potential credential access techniques, such as password-spraying, brute-forcing, replay attacks, and other similar threats.
