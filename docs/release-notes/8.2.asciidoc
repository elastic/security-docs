[[deprecations-8.2.0]]
==== Deprecations
The following endpoints are deprecated ({pull}129448[#129448]) and will be removed in a future release. They will remain active for at least the next 18 months:

* <<bulk-actions-rules-api-create,`/api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_create`>>
* <<bulk-actions-rules-api-delete,`/api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_delete`>>
* <<bulk-actions-rules-api-update,`/api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_update`>>

To avoid breakage, we recommend using the <<bulk-actions-rules-api,bulk rule actions>> API instead for similar bulk actions.  You can also use the <<rules-api-create,create>>, <<rules-api-update,update>>, and <<rules-api-delete,delete>> rule APIs to manage rules individually.
