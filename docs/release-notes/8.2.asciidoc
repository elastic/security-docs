* Indicator match rules cannot use the `.items-*` system index and will encounter execution errors when run. Avoid using indices populated from value lists for indicator match rules ({pull}133457[#133457]).
* The `matches` operator in the *Add Rule Exception* flyout does not work because wildcard matches are not supported for rule exceptions. Using the `matches` operator will cause rule exceptions and their associated rules to fail. You can restore failed rules by deleting unsupported exceptions and refreshing the rules ({issue}136340[#136340]).
* A new Lucene 9 validation change may cause event correlation (EQL) rule errors whenever rule queries contain regular expressions using wildcard fields and predefined character classes (for example, `\w`, `\s`, `\d`).

[[deprecations-8.2.0]]
==== Deprecations
The following endpoints are deprecated ({pull}129448[#129448]) and will be removed in a future release. They will remain active for at least the next 18 months:

* <<bulk-actions-rules-api-create,`/api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_create`>>
* <<bulk-actions-rules-api-delete,`/api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_delete`>>
* <<bulk-actions-rules-api-update,`/api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_update`>>

To avoid breakage, we recommend using the <<bulk-actions-rules-api,bulk rule actions>> API instead for similar bulk actions.  You can also use the <<rules-api-create,create>>, <<rules-api-update,update>>, and <<rules-api-delete,delete>> rule APIs to manage rules individually.
