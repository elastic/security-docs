[[known-issue-8.2.0]]
==== Known issues
* On macOS versions before 12.4, if {elastic-endpoint} is used with other products that monitor or manage network traffic (such as antivirus programs, firewalls, or VPNs), users might experience network connection issues. To resolve this issue, upgrade to macOS 12.4 or later.
* Indicator match rules cannot use the `.items-*` system index and will encounter execution errors when run. Avoid using indices populated from value lists for indicator match rules ({kibana-pull}133457[#133457]).
* The `matches` operator in the *Add Rule Exception* flyout does not work because wildcard matches are not supported for rule exceptions. Using the `matches` operator will cause rule exceptions and their associated rules to fail. You can restore failed rules by deleting unsupported exceptions and refreshing the rules ({kibana-issue}136340[#136340]).
* A new Lucene 9 validation change may cause event correlation (EQL) rule errors whenever rule queries contain regular expressions using wildcard fields and predefined character classes (for example, `\w`, `\s`, `\d`).

[[deprecations-8.2.0]]
==== Deprecations
The following endpoints are deprecated ({kibana-pull}129448[#129448]) and will be removed in a future release. They will remain active for at least the next 18 months:

* <<bulk-actions-rules-api-create,`/api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_create`>>
* <<bulk-actions-rules-api-delete,`/api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_delete`>>
* <<bulk-actions-rules-api-update,`/api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_update`>>

To avoid breakage, we recommend using the <<bulk-actions-rules-api,bulk rule actions>> API instead for similar bulk actions.  You can also use the <<rules-api-create,create>>, <<rules-api-update,update>>, and <<rules-api-delete,delete>> rule APIs to manage rules individually.
