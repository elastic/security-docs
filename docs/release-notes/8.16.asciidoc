[[breaking-changes-8.16.0]]
==== Breaking changes

* During shutdown, Kibana now waits for all the ongoing requests to complete according to the `server.shutdownTimeout` setting. During that period, the incoming socket is closed and any new incoming requests are rejected. Before this update, new incoming requests received a response with the status code 503 and body { "message": "Kibana is shutting down and not accepting new incoming requests" }.

[[features-8.16.0]]
==== New features

// * Introduces a new API route for listing Entity Store entities: `GET /api/entity_store/entities/list` ({kibana-pull}192806[#192806]).
* Enables detection rules to automatically execute system actions such as opening a case ({kibana-pull}183937[#183937]). 
* Adds syntax validation for {esql} queries ({kibana-pull}189780[#189780]).
* Creates an option for {esql} and EQL rule previews `Show {es} requests, ran during rule executions`. When enabled, {es} queries that run during rule execution appear under "Preview logged requests" in the rule preview ({kibana-pull}191107[#191107]).
* Allows you to create and update a rule even when some data-related validation errors are present in the query field ({kibana-pull}191487[#191487]).
* Creates a new advanced setting `securitySolution:enableVisualizationsInFlyout`. When enabled, a "Visualizations" section with Analyzer and Session view previews appears in the alerts and events flyouts ({kibana-pull}194012[#194012], {kibana-pull}192531[#192531]).
* Creates a new advanced setting `securitySolution:excludedDataTiersForRuleExecution` that allows you to exclude cold and frozen data tiers from search during rule execution (does not apply to {esql} or Machine learning rules) ({kibana-pull}186908[#186908]). 
* Adds an "Insights" section containing any available misconfiguration and vulnerabilities findings to the alert and event flyouts ({kibana-pull}195509[#195509]).
* Removes the `securitySolution:enableAssetCriticality` advanced setting and enables <<asset-criticality, Asset Criticality>> workflows by default ({kibana-pull}196270[#196270])
* Adds an {elastic-defend} integration policy advanced setting that, when enabled, adds file hashes to file events ({kibana-pull}192037[#192037]).
* Adds RBAC for Elastic AI Assistant's knowledge base ({kibana-pull}195733[#195733]).
* Adds RBAC for Attack Discovery ({kibana-pull}188788[#188788]).
* Adds historical results to the Data Quality dashboard and updates its UI ({kibana-pull}191898[#191898], {kibana-pull}196127[#196127]). 
* Enables agentless deployment for Elastic's Cloud Security Posture Management integration ({kibana-pull}191557[#191557]).

[[enhancements-8.16.0]]
==== Enhancements
* Enables you to open the Rule details flyout from the Alerts table ({kibana-pull}191764[#191764]).
* Enables you to resize expanded flyouts ({kibana-pull}192906[#192906]).
* Enables a settings menu for flyouts that lets you select between `Overlay` and `Push` display modes ({kibana-pull}182615[#182615]).
* Allows you to enable entity risk scoring in multiple {kib} spaces ({kibana-pull}192671[#192671]).
* Creates a new API endpoint for cleaning up entity risk scoring data: `DELETE /api/risk_score/engine/dangerously_delete_data` ({kibana-pull}191843[#191843], {kibana-pull}189872[#189872]). 
* Removes Elastic AI Assistant's default system prompts. The instructions previously contained in those prompts are now automatically included without user interaction, so Elastic AI Assistant will remain focused on relevant topics. Custom system prompts are still available ({kibana-pull}191847[#191847]). 
* Improves Elastic AI Assistant's ability to generate {esql} queries ({kibana-pull}195480[#195480], {kibana-pull}188492[#188492]). 
* Adds a button that lets you quickly add queries generated by Elastic AI Assistant to a rule's definition ({kibana-pull}190963[#190963]).
* Adds an "Other" option to the OpenAI connector's "Select an OpenAI provider" dropdown menu. Select this option when <<connect-to-byo-llm, connecting to your own custom LLM>> ({kibana-pull}194831[#194831]).
* Improves Attack Discovery ({kibana-pull}195669[#195669]): 
** AD can now process up to 500 alerts (previous maximum: 100). This setting can now be adjusted directly from the Attack Discovery page, and is stored locally instead of in {es}
** AD now combines related discoveries that would previously have appeared separately
** AD now detects and displays an error instead of hallucinated output
* Adds an `Install and enable` button to the preuilt rule UI, so you don't have to wait for rules to install before enabling them ({kibana-pull}191529[#191529]). 
* Improves the `/upgrade/_perform` API endpoint used for upgrading rules to better handle Elastic rules that you customized, better handle special fields, and use `PUT` instead of `PATCH` logic for rule updates ({kibana-pull}191439[#191439]). 
* Updates the Get Started tour for {elastic-sec} ({kibana-pull}192247[#192247]). 
* Improves loading performance for various pages in {kib} ({kibana-pull}194241[#194241]). 
* Adds Alert Suppression and Investigation Fields to the rule upgrade workflow ({kibana-pull}195499[#195499]). 
* Adds User and Global Artifacts to the {fleet} Policy Response flyout and to the Endpoint Details flyout ({kibana-pull}184125[#184125]). 
* Allows you to set the risk scoring engine to run automatically after you upload asset criticality data ({kibana-pull}187577[#187577]). 
* Adds a {kib} advanced setting `securitySolution:maxUnassociatedNotes` that allows you to set the maximum number of notes that are not associated with a timeline ({kibana-pull}194947[#194947]). 
* Adds the `IS` operator as an option when configuring a Windows signature blocklist entry ({kibana-pull}190515[#190515]). 
* Allows you to disable the defend hardware call stacks feature ({kibana-pull}190553[#190553]). 
* Improves network previews in the Alert details flyout ({kibana-pull}190560[#190560]).
