==== Breaking changes

* During shutdown, Kibana now waits for all the ongoing requests to complete according to the `server.shutdownTimeout` setting. During that period, the incoming socket is closed and any new incoming requests are rejected. Before this update, new incoming requests received a response with the status code 503 and body { "message": "Kibana is shutting down and not accepting new incoming requests" }.

* Adds syntax validation for {esql} queries ({kibana-pull}189780[#189780]).

* Creates a new advanced setting `securitySolution:excludedDataTiersForRuleExecution` that allows you to exclude cold and frozen data tiers from search during rule execution (does not apply to {esql} or Machine learning rules) ({kibana-pull}186908[#186908]). 

* Adds an "Insights" section containing any available misconfiguration and vulnerabilities findings to the alert and event flyouts ({kibana-pull}195509[#195509]).
