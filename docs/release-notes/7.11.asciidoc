==== Breaking changes

*Referential integrity issues when deleting value lists*

The `/api/lists` `DELETE` API has been updated to check for references before removing the specified resource(s) from value lists and will now return a 409 conflict if any references exist. Set the new `ignoreReferences` query param to `true` to maintain the behavior of deleting value list(s) without performing any additional checks.

[[known-issues-7.11.0]]
==== Known issues

* The Elastic Endpoint Security rule will report a failure status until the Endpoint sends an alert for the first time. At that point, the next rule execution will succeed.  `logs-endpoint.alerts-*` index pattern does not get created until the Endpoint sends the first alert ({kibana-issue}90401[#90401]).

* In the Alert Details Summary view, values for some fields appear truncated. You'll only be able to see the first character ({kibana-issue}90539[#90539]).
