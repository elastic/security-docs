[[known-issue-8.11.0]]
==== Known issues
* MITRE ATT&CK® technique cells show duplicate rules ({issue}167929[#167929]).
* MITRE ATT&CK® tactic cells show an incorrect rule count ({issue}167930[#167930]).
* An incorrect MITRE ATT&CK® sub-technique is applied after you save a rule ({issue}170347[#170347]).
* When using {elastic-defend}'s protection updates feature, if you turn off automatic updates and select the current day as your deployed artifacts version, it's possible that the set of protections has not been released for that day yet. As a result, {agent} could fail to download the artifacts and be set to an Unhealthy state. To avoid this issue, pick a date previous to the current one ({issue}170847[#170847]).

[[breaking-changes-8.11.0]]
==== Breaking changes
* Ends support for the `filterQuery` field of the `getLiveQueryResults` and `findLiveQuery` APIs, and replaces it with the KQL field `kuery`. Requests to those APIs that used the `filterQuery` field should replace it with `kuery` ({pull}161806[#161806]).
* In 8.11, rule APIs will only support `investigation_fields` as `{ field_names: string[] }`. If you've added this field to your rules in 8.10, you don't need to do anything when you import your rules.

[[deprecations-8.11.0]]
==== Deprecations
* Deprecates the `doc_root.vulnerability.package` and replaces it with the `doc_root.package` ECS package ({pull}164651[#164651]).

[[features-8.11.0]]
==== New features
* Upgrades {elastic-defend} to capture a new Windows event type: ETW Threat Intelligence (ETW-TI). Renames the Windows events policy `Credential access` category to `API` in the UI (but not in the `.yaml`, maintaining backwards compatibility). Adds two new advanced options: `windows.advanced.events.api_disabled` and
`windows.advanced.events.api_verbose` ({pull}167549[#167549]).
* Adds the `Same family` category and tab to the Data Quality dashboard. Fields with mappings in the same family have the same search behavior as the type specified by ECS, but may have different space usage or performance characteristics ({pull}167480[#167480]).
* Updates the exceptions flyout's `match_any` operator to accept duplicate values that differ in case ({pull}167208[#167208]).
* beta:[] Enables the Elastic AI Assistant to answer questions about Elasticsearch Query Language (ES|QL) by allowing it to query, via ELSER, an ES|QL knowledge base. Refer to <<security-assistant, Elastic AI Assistant>> to enable the knowledge base ({pull}167097[#167097]).
* Enables ES|QL in Timeline (technical preview) ({pull}166764[#166764]).
* Adds the new ES|QL rule type (technical preview) ({pull}165450[#165450]).
* Updates the Endpoint policy UI (**Manage -> Policies**) to include a `Protection updates` tab, a new column called `Deployed version`, and a banner that highlights outdated policies ({pull}165256[#165256], {pull}162719[#162719]).
* Introduces full support for {elastic-endpoint} on macOS Sonoma (https://github.com/elastic/endpoint-dev/issues/13058[#13058]).
* Updates {elastic-defend} to support AlmaLinux 9 and Rocky Linux 9 (https://github.com/elastic/endpoint-dev/pull/13613[#13613]).
* Adds a new optional parameter to {elastic-endpoint}'s `top` command. The `--limit` parameter specifies how many times to refresh the command's output before a graceful exit (https://github.com/elastic/endpoint-dev/pull/13608[#13608]).

[[enhancements-8.11.0]]
==== Enhancements
* Adds a new Generative AI connector, Amazon Bedrock, for use with Elastic AI Assistant ({pull}166662[#166662]).
* Renames the Generative AI connector to OpenAI, since Generative AI is now a category of connectors that include OpenAI and Amazon Bedrock ({pull}167677[#167677]).
* Adds the `id`, `severity`, and `status` fields to the Webhook - Case Management connector ({pull}166295[#166295]).
* Updates the order of items on {kib}'s left-side navigation menu to match the order in {elastic-sec}'s left-side navigation menu ({pull}164268[#164268]).
* Adds tooltips to overview section titles in the alert details flyout ({pull}166737[#166737]).
* Updates the `.lists` and `.items` indices to data streams ({pull}162508[#162508]).

* Sets the date and time picker to full width in the expanded Prevalence view within the alert details flyout ({pull}166714[#166714]).
* Fixes a bug that could prevent the **Install Cloud Native Vulnerability Management** button on the empty state of the Findings page from working ({pull}166335[#166335]).
