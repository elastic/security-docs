[[breaking-changes-8.15.0]]
==== Breaking changes

* If you previously created any user-defined quick prompts for Elastic AI Assistant, they will no longer appear after you upgrade to 8.15. To resolve this, copy your existing quick prompts prior to upgrading, then add them again after upgrading. Additionally, in 8.15, quick prompts are shared by all users in your deployment, rather than saved at the user level ({kibana-pull}187040[#187040]).
