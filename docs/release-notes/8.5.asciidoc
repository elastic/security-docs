[[known-issue-8.5.0]]
==== Known issues
* Users might experience slightly longer installation and upgrade times for the user and host risk score features ({pull}142434[#142434]).
* Version 8.5.0 {endpoint}s running on Linux systems with many CPUs may become unhealthy. For a workaround refer to https://github.com/elastic/endpoint/issues/34[issue #34]

==== Breaking changes
// tag::breaking-changes[]
// NOTE: The breaking-changes tagged regions are reused in the Elastic Installation and Upgrade Guide. The pull attribute is defined within this snippet so it properly resolves in the output.
:pull: {pull}
* Host and user risk score features that were installed in 8.4 or earlier are not ECS-compatible and, therefore, cannot generate new risk scores in 8.5. Before upgrading, users can archive their existing risk indices if they want to keep their old host and user risk scores. Otherwise, new risk indices will be generated once users upgrade host and user risk score features ({pull}140377[#140377]).

* Endpoint response actions history has a standalone page for all endpoints ({pull}140306[#140306]).
* Introduces the Entity Analytics dashboard, which showcases host and user risk scores and anomalies. Also adds host and user risk data to the user and host detail pages. These features require a Platinum license or higher. ({pull}137688[#137688], {pull}140270[#140270], {pull}139462[#139462]).
* Updates the *Anomalies* tab to display the same quantity of anomalies when navigating from the Entity Analytics dashboard ({pull}139910[#139910]).
* Enriches alerts with host and user risk scores ({pull}139478[#139478]).
* Enables the Indicators page by default and makes the functionality generally available ({pull}141117[#141117]).
* Allows indicator data to be investigated in Timeline by including the *Add to Timeline* button throughout the Indicators table ({pull}138836[#138836], {pull}140496[#140496]).
* Removes the Host risk score card from the Overview dashboard ({pull}140177[#140177]).
* Adds the option to bulk edit rule schedules to the bulk actions menu in the Rules table ({pull}140166[#140166]).
* Adds the option to bulk edit rule actions to the bulk actions menu in the Rules table ({pull}138900[#138900]).
* Adds an alert count card to the User, Host, and Network detail pages. The card shows alerts per rule and can be filtered by alert status ({pull}140150[#140150]).

* Updates the UI for the rule details page's *Exceptions* tab ({pull}138770[#138770]).
* Enables the Osquery Response Action on custom query detection rules, and adds an *Osquery Results* tab to the Alert details flyout. Users can use the Osquery Response Action to immediately query hosts that generate alerts ({pull}133279[#133279]).
* Enables rule exceptions to reference value lists, regardless of rule type. One caveat is that text type value lists still do not work for EQL and threshold rules ({pull}133254[#133254]).
