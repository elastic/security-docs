[[breaking-changes-8.5.0]]
==== Breaking changes
// tag::breaking-changes[]
// NOTE: The breaking-changes tagged regions are reused in the Elastic Installation and Upgrade Guide. The pull attribute is defined within this snippet so it properly resolves in the output.
:pull: {pull}
* Host and user risk score features that were installed in 8.4 or earlier are not ECS-compatible and, therefore, cannot generate new risk scores in 8.5. Before upgrading, users can archive their existing risk indices if they want to keep their old host and user risk scores. Otherwise, new risk indices will be generated once users upgrade host and user risk score features ({pull}140377[#140377]).

* Updates the *Anomalies* tab to display the same quantity of anomalies when navigating from the Entity Analytics dashboard ({pull}139910[#139910]).
* Enriches alerts with host and user risk scores ({pull}139478[#139478]).
* Enables the Indicators page by default if users have an https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Enterprise subscription] and makes the functionality generally available ({pull}141117[#141117]).
* Allows indicator data to be investigated in Timeline by including the *Add to Timeline* button throughout the Indicators table ({pull}138836[#138836], {pull}140496[#140496]).

* Adds the option to bulk edit rule actions to the bulk actions menu in the Rules table ({pull}138900[#138900]).
