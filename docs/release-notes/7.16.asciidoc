[[features-7.16.0]]
==== Features
* Adds the ability to configure trusted applications on a per-policy basis, allowing security administrators to target a set of hosts with specific configurations and settings. For example, trusted applications can be tailored to certain functions within an organization or for testing and troubleshooting purposes ({kibana-pull}112182[#112182], {kibana-pull}111051[#111051], {kibana-pull}110966[#110966]).
* Adds memory threat protection for macOS and Linux systems  ({kibana-pull}114799[#114799]).

* Allows cases to be imported and exported as saved objects ({kibana-pull}110148[#110148]).
* Highlights the top riskiest hosts in a user's environment, based on a normalized host risk score scale of 0 to 100.  ({kibana-pull}109553[#109553]).
* Adds host risk metadata to alert details ({kibana-pull}113274[#113274]).
* Switches the order of the *Count* table and the *Trend* histogram on the Alerts page ({kibana-pull}117878[#117878]).
* Removes assigned policies from trusted applications when removing the {endpoint-sec} integration ({kibana-pull}108347[#108347]).

[[bug-fixes-7.16.0]]
==== Bug fixes and enhancements
* Moves the *Analyze event* option from the overflow menu to the *Actions* column within the Alerts and Events tables. It now only displays events that can be opened in the visual event analyzer ({kibana-pull}115478[#115478]).
* Halts indicator match rule execution after the allotted time interval has passed ({kibana-pull}115288[#115288]).
* Allows detection rule actions to be migrated to a centralized Kibana alerting framework. Users may receive notifications sooner after alerts have been generated, depending on rule configuration and actions frequency ({kibana-pull}115243[#115243], {kibana-pull}115101[#115101]).
* Changes the prebuilt indicator match rule's interval and lookback time to one hour ({kibana-pull}115185[#115185]).
* Allows exceptions to be exported with rules ({kibana-pull}115144[#115144]).
* Improves the formatting of array values and JSON in the *Table* and *JSON* tabs ({kibana-pull}115141[#115141]).
* Provides users with a new, simpler way to add data to their environments through the {agent} ({kibana-pull}115016[#115016], {kibana-pull}112142[#112142]).
* Enables the Index connector and action for the Detection engine ({kibana-pull}111813[#111813]).
* Hides building block rules on the Overview page ({kibana-pull}105611[#105611]).
* Corrects the distorted view of the "Status" badge in the Alert details flyout ({kibana-pull}116237[#116237]).
* Improves the display of rule status errors caused by user permissions to the source index ({kibana-pull}115114[#115114]).
* Fixes the exceptions export route ({kibana-pull}114920[#114920]).
* Restores local storage persistence for the Alerts table and the Remove Column action ({kibana-pull}114742[#114742]).
* Fixes issues that occurred when adding the {endpoint-sec} integration to an {agent} policy in {fleet} ({kibana-pull}114467[#114467]).
* Updates the Indexing Time and Query Time columns in the Rule Monitoring table to be SUM, instead of MAX ({kibana-pull}114023[#114023]).
* Fixes a bug that prevented dialogs on the Overview page from opening when users clicked on the *Inspect* button ({kibana-pull}113161[#113161]).
* Sets a new default indicator index query that checks indicator index patterns for matched indicators that have occurred in the past 30 days ({kibana-pull}112300[#112300]).
* Decodes file names on uploaded value lists and fixes a bug that stopped value lists from being deleted ({kibana-pull}111838[#111838]).
* Fixes a bug that allowed users to create a trusted application with an empty `name` field ({kibana-pull}111508[#111508]).
* Removes duplicate exception lists on rule export when multiple rules reference the same list ({kibana-pull}116698[#116698]).
* Disables scrolling when activity data isn't present in the endpoint activity log ({kibana-pull}118406[#118406]).

[[upcoming-breaking-changes-7.16.0]]
==== Upcoming breaking changes
*Changes to detection rule preview functionality:*

To improve the detection engine's rule preview functionality in 8.0.0, preview alerts will be written to a new index called the signals preview index (`.siem-signals-preview*`). In order to view this index and use the updated rule preview functionality, roles must have `read` privileges to the new signals preview index. Also note that, other than their index lifecycle management policies, signal preview indices are nearly identical to existing signal indices ({kibana-pull}116374[#116374]).

To give a role `read` privileges to the new signals preview index:

. Open the main menu, then go to *Management -> Stack Management -> Security -> Roles*.
. Select the custom role you want to update.
. Modify the role's index privileges as follows:
.. *Indices*: Enter the signals preview indices that correspond with the signals indices. For example, the `.siem-signals-preview*` index pattern corresponds with the `.siem-signals*` index pattern. Similarly, the `.siem-signals-preview-<KIBANA-SPACE>*` index pattern corresponds with the `.siem-signals-<KIBANA-SPACE>*` index pattern.
.. *Privileges*: Enter `read`.
. Click *Update role* to save your changes.

*Upcoming changes to case feature privileges*

In 8.0.0, case feature privileges will no longer be a sub-feature under {elastic-sec} ({kibana-pull}113172[#113172]).
