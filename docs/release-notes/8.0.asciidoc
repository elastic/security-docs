[[known-issues-8.0.0]]
==== Known issues
*Case migration errors might be logged when upgrading*

You might find the `Failed to migrate user action alerts` error message in your {kib} migration logs when upgrading to {stack} version 8.0.0. This error is incorrectly logged when migrating cases and can be ignored ({kibana-pull}124950[#124950]).

Here is an example of an error message you might encounter:

[code block]
----
[2022-02-07T20:25:58.614+00:00][ERROR][savedobjects-service] Failed to migrate user action alerts with doc id: 7420fe08-c2ed-51d2-b077-46deb4bf76c9 version: 8.0.0 error: Unexpected token in JSON at position 0
----

*Existing or new rules that use the legacy alerts index may temporarily fail after upgrading*

After you upgrade to {stack} version 8.0.0, existing and new rules might fail to execute  if their source index is configured to use a legacy alert index pattern created in {stack} version 7.x (`.siem-signals-<space-id>`). Rule failures will likely cause detection gaps, which will be proportional in time to the scheduled interval of the rule. Rules will start to successfully execute after legacy alerts are no longer within the scheduled time period queried by the rule. Despite this automatic correction, coverage gaps might still remain ({kibana-pull}124327[#124327]).

*The Threat Intel Filebeat Module (v8.x) Indicator Match rule query is misconfigured*

The indicator index query of the prebuilt rule is misconfigured and will prevent the rule from generating alerts ({kibana-pull}121045[#121045], {kibana-pull}1560[#1560]). To resolve this, duplicate the rule and update its settings:

. Go to the Rules table (*Detect -> Rules*).
. Locate the Threat Intel Filebeat Module (v8.x) Indicator Match prebuilt rule.
+
TIP: You can search for the rule by entering the rule name in the Rule table's search bar.

. Click the rule to view the rule details.
. Click the actions menu, then click *Duplicate rule*.
. Go to the *Indicator index query* field and update the query by removing `event.dataset:ti_*` and replacing it with `event.module:threatintel`. For reference, the correct query is:

+
[code block]
----
`@timestamp >= "now-30d" and event.module:threatintel and (threat.indicator.file.hash.*:* or threat.indicator.file.pe.imphash:* or threat.indicator.ip:* or threat.indicator.registry.path:* or threat.indicator.url.full:*)`
----

. Under the *Indicator index query* field, update the query's filters by removing `event.dataset:ti_*` and replacing it with `event.module:threatintel`.
. Save the changes.
. Activate the rule.

*The import process fails for rules with exception comments*

Comments on rule exceptions cause the import process to fail because the following system-generated fields cannot be validated for exception comments ({kibana-pull}124742[#124742]):

 * `created_at`
 * `created_by`
 * `updated_at`
 * `updated_by`
 * `id`

To complete the rule import process successfully, edit the exported `.ndjson` file and re-import it:

. Search the exported `.ndjson` file for exceptions with comments. Exception comments are stored within the `exceptionItem` object in the `comments` field.
. Edit the exception comment's fields:
** To preserve the comment during the import process, only delete the `created_at`, `created_by`, `updated_at`, `updated_by`, and `id` fields.
** If you don't want to preserve the comment, remove the comment entirely.
. Save the file and re-import it.

*Network connection issues might occur if {elastic-endpoint} is used with network traffic tools*

On macOS versions before 12.4, if {elastic-endpoint} is used with other products that monitor or manage network traffic (such as antivirus programs, firewalls, or VPNs), users might experience network connection issues. To resolve this issue, upgrade to macOS 12.4 or later.

*Lucene 9 validation change may affect event correlation rules*

A new Lucene 9 validation change may cause event correlation (EQL) rule errors whenever rule queries contain regular expressions using wildcard fields and predefined character classes (for example, `\w`, `\s`, `\d`).

[[breaking-changes-8.0.0]]
==== Breaking Changes

* Removes the trusted application API. The trusted application interface retains current functionality, but now uses the exception list API ({kibana-pull}120134[#120134]).
* Removes the list endpoint metadata API ({kibana-pull}119401[#119401]).
* Lets you grant privileges for cases separately from {elastic-sec} privileges ({kibana-pull}113573[#113573], {kibana-pull}112980[#112980]). As a result of this change, you must update case privileges for existing roles _before_ upgrading to {stack} 8.0.0. Follow these steps:
. Open the main menu and click *Management -> Stack Management -> Stack -> Upgrade Assistant*.
. From the Upgrade Assistant page, review the Kibana deprecation warnings. A message prompts you to update role privileges because of changes to the {elastic-sec} Cases feature.
. Click the message to open it, then click *Quick resolve*.
. Refresh the page to verify the deprecation was resolved, then return to the guided steps on the Upgrade Assistant page.

* Fixes an overlap between the rule query text field and Timeline banner ({kibana-pull}121967[#121967], {kibana-pull}121127[#121127]).
* Adds support for the `threat.feed.name` field in the alert details flyout and Timeline view ({kibana-pull}120250[#120250]).
* Adds the default threat indicator path (`threat_indicator_path`) to indicator match rules where it was missing ({kibana-pull}118962[#118962]).

[[known-issues-8.0.0-rc2]]
==== Known issues

*The Data view option might not display in upgraded environments with legacy alerts*

To make the *Data view* option appear, a user with elevated role privileges must visit the {security-app}, open a page that displays alert data (such as the Overview page), then refresh the page ({kibana-pull}121390[#121390]).

The role must have the following privileges:

* *Cluster privileges*: The `manage` privilege
* *Index privileges*: The `manage`, `write`,`read`, and `view_index_metadata` index privileges for the following system indices where `<space-id>` is the {kib} space name:

** `.siem-signals-<space-id>`
** `.lists-<space-id>`
** `.items-<space-id>`
** `.alerts-security.alerts-<space-id>`
** `.internal.alerts-security.alerts-<space-id>-*`

* *{kib} space*: `All` privileges for the `Security` feature (visit
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges] for more information)

NOTE: If new alerts are generated in an upgraded environment without legacy alerts, refreshing any page with alert data in {elastic-sec} will make the *Data view* option appear in the {elastic-sec} UI.

*Detection rules may not generate alerts after upgrading to {stack} 8.0.0*

Rules are automatically disabled during the upgrade process and must be manually re-enabled after the process completes. Failure to do so could cause a gap in rule coverage ({kibana-pull}120906[#120906]).

Before upgrading, use the <<rules-api-find, Find rules>> API to retrieve a list of enabled detection rules in your environment. You can reference this list when re-enabling rules after you upgrade.

We recommend using curl or another HTTP tool to securely run {elastic-sec} APIs. Below is an example curl command that retrieves a list of your enabled rules:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /api/detection_engine/rules/_find?per_page=10000&filter=alert.attributes.enabled:true
--------------------------------------------------

After upgrading, follow these steps to re-enable your rules from the Rules page:

. Go to the All rules table (*Detect -> Rules*).
. Select the rules that you want to enable.
. Click *Bulk actions -> Enable* to re-enable the rules.

Alternatively, you can use the <<bulk-actions-rules-api-action, Bulk rule actions>> API to re-enable rules.

*Lucene 9 validation change may affect event correlation rules*

A new Lucene 9 validation change may cause event correlation (EQL) rule errors whenever rule queries contain regular expressions using wildcard fields and predefined character classes (for example, `\w`, `\s`, `\d`).
