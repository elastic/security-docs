==== Known issues

*The Data view option might not display in upgraded environments with legacy alerts*

To make the *Data view* option appear, a user with elevated role privileges must visit the {es-sec-app}, open a page that displays alert data (such as the Overview page), then refresh the page. ({pull}121390[#121390]).

The role must have the following privileges:

* *Cluster privileges*: The `manage` privilege
* *Index privileges*: The `manage`, `write`,`read`, and `view_index_metadata` index privileges for the following system indices where `<kib-space>` is the {kib} space name:

** `.siem-signals-<kib-space>`
** `.lists-<kib-space>`
** `.items-<kib-space>`
** `.alerts-security.alerts-<kib-space>`
** `.internal.alerts-security.alerts-<kib-space>-*`

* *{kib} space*: `All` privileges for the `Security` feature (visit
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges] for more information)

NOTE: If new alerts are generated in an upgraded environment without legacy alerts, refreshing any page with alert data in {elastic-sec} will make the *Data view* option appear in the {es-sec-ui}.

*Detection rules may not generate alerts after upgrading to {stack} 8.0.0*

If you do not manually disable rules before upgrading to {stack} version 8.0.0, they're automatically disabled during the upgrade process and must be manually re-enabled after the process completes. Failure to do so could cause a gap in rule coverage ({pull}120906[#120906]).

NOTE: To use the {es-sec} API to re-enable rules, refer to <<bulk-actions-rules-api, Bulk rule actions>>.

To re-enable your rules from the Rules page:

. Go to the All rules table (*Detect -> Rules*).
. Click *Select all (number) rules* *Rule* select all rules.
. Click *Bulk actions -> Activate Selected* to re-enable all rules.
