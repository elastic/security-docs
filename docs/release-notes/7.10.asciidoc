[[upgrade-notes-7.10]]
==== Post upgrade requirements

When upgrading the {stack} to version 7.10.0 from a previous minor version (7.9.x),
perform the following:

* Grant `view_index_metadata` https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/detections-permissions-section.html#enable-detections-ui[permissions] to any Elastic Security users. This is required to enable **event correlation** rules. Other previously activated detection rules will continue to run after upgrade.

[[breaking-changes-7.10.0]]
==== Breaking changes

*Signals template updated for rollover indices*

The `create_index_route` now checks if the template needs to be upgraded
before creating the index. If the index already exists and the template was upgraded,
the index rolls over so that the write index has the upgraded mapping.
This breaks the old mappings that have `risk_score mapped` as a keyword.
In the new mapping, `signal.rule.risk_score` is a float.  After rolling over,
there is a conflict between the old and new `signal.rule.risk_score` for some
features, such as aggregations.

This requires the `view_index_metadata` permission in Kibana. See ({kibana-pull}/80019[#80019]) for details.

*Connect incident fields allowed when cases are sent*

You can now specify connector incident fields when cases are sent. This includes:
* Jira: issue type, priority, and parent issue in the case of a subtask.
* IBM Resilient: issue types, and severity.
* ServiceNow: urgency, severity, and impact.

See ({kibana-pull}77327[#77327]) for details.
