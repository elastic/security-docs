[[known-issue-8.4.2]]
==== Known issues
* A new Lucene 9 validation change may cause event correlation rule (EQL) errors whenever rule queries contain regular expressions using wildcard fields and predefined character classes (for example, `\w`, `\s`, `\d`).

[[bug-fixes-8.4.2]]
==== Bug fixes and enhancements
* Removes access to the **Notes** and **Pinned** tabs in Timeline templates ({pull}140478[#140478]).
* Fixes a bug with the **Attach to existing case** option in Timeline ({pull}139929[#139929]).
* Fixes bugs in the Rules table that affected the selected rule count and bulk select feature ({pull}139461[#139461]).
* Fixes a bug that caused the Rules page to incorrectly notify users that a prebuilt rules update was available, even after rules were fully updated ({pull}139287[#139287]).
* Fixes a bug that prevented users from accessing alert details if they didn't have the appropriate privileges to view the internal index `.internal.alerts-security.alerts-spaceId`. Now, the Alert details flyout correctly uses the public alias index `.alerts-security.alerts-<Kibana-space>` ({pull}138331[#138331]).
* Aligns the warning message title on the Rule details page with the warning icon ({pull}140719[#140719]).

[[known-issue-8.4.0]]
==== Known issues
* If additional look-back time is set for the advanced query rule preview, alerts from source documents that are outside the preview time frame may not appear in the preview ({pull}137422[#137422]).
* A new Lucene 9 validation change may cause event correlation (EQL) rule errors whenever rule queries contain regular expressions using wildcard fields and predefined character classes (for example, `\w`, `\s`, `\d`).
* The Rules page incorrectly displays a notification that an update for prebuilt rules is available even if the rules have been fully updated. Currently, there is no way to remove or hide the notification ({pull}139095[#139095]).

[[features-8.4.0]]
==== Features
* Creates a new rule type, New Terms, that creates an alert when a value appears for the first time in a particular field ({pull}134526[#134526]).
* Adds the Insights section to the Alert details flyout to show related cases and alerts ({pull}136009[#136009], {pull}138419[#138419])
* Shows process alerts in the event process analyzer ({pull}135340[#135340]).
* Adds support for wildcard exceptions for detection rules. New operators are `matches` and `does not match` ({pull}136147[#136147]).
* Adds a new search query parameter, `dry_run`, to the bulk actions API that allows you to simulate a bulk action without permanently updating rules ({pull}134664[#134664]).
* Creates the response console, an interface that enables you to take actions on specific hosts ({pull}135360[#135360], {pull}134520[#134520]).
* Includes integration policy errors and statuses in {fleet} and {elastic-sec} to help troubleshoot when an {agent} has an `Unhealthy` status ({pull}136241[#136241], {pull}136038[#136038]).
* Adds Attack surface reduction protections feature to reduce vulnerabilities on Windows endpoints. Credential hardening prevents attackers from stealing credentials stored in Windows system process memory.
* Adds an endpoint self-healing feature to roll back file changes and processes on Windows endpoints when a prevention alert is generated by enabled protection features.
* Adds the ability to run query packs as live queries ({pull}132198[#132198]).
* Provides support for process, file, and network events in Kubernetes. You must enable the session view data setting on your {endpoint-cloud-sec} integration policy to enrich these events with session data and Kubernetes metadata fields.
* Adds support for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM).
* Adds new fields to prebuilt detection rules' schemas: `related_integrations`, `required_fields`, and `setup` ({pull}132409[#132409]).
* Adds the *Related integrations*, *Required fields*, and *Setup guide* sections to the rule details page to help users identify and meet a rule's prerequisites. Also adds the related integrations badge to the Rules table ({pull}131475[#131475]).
