[[features-7.14.1]]
==== Features
* The `securitySolution:defaultThreatIndex` advanced setting defines threat intelligence indices that {elastic-sec} will use when collecting threat indicators. The setting controls features that query threat indices, such as the Threat Intelligence view on the Overview page and the default indicator index values for indicator match rules. One or more threat intelligence indices can be defined; the `filebeat-*` index is specified by default. See <<update-threat-intel-indices, Update default Elastic Security threat intelligence indices>> for more information ({kibana-pull}108389[#108389]).

[[features-7.14.0]]
==== Features
* Host isolation allows analysts to isolate hosts from their networks while investigating a potential attack. Analysts can use this feature to respond to malicious activity by containing infected hosts, curbing potential attacks, and preventing lateral movement to other hosts. This feature is supported on Windows and macOS.
* Adds malware protection for Linux endpoints. Users can enable Linux malware protection in their policy to receive detection alerts ({kibana-pull}103404[#103404])({kibana-pull}95014[#95014])({kibana-pull}104984[#104984]).
* Adds threat intelligence to alerts ({kibana-pull}101553[#101553])({kibana-pull}103383[#103383]).
* Introduces the Swimlane connector for rules and cases ({kibana-pull}100086[#100086]).
* Introduces role-based access control for cases and allows users to be given all, write, or no access to cases ({kibana-pull}95058[#95058]).
* Adds new functionality and usability improvements to the Osquery Manager integration:
** Users can create and curate a library of saved queries.
** When running a live query, users can select a saved query or create a new one.
** Scheduled queries can be constrained to a particular OS or osquery version.
** Users can view who ran or scheduled a query, which is helpful during auditing.
** The agent list for live queries only shows enrolled agents to make selecting targets easier.
* Enhances alert documents to have the fields of `constant_keyword`, runtime fields, aliases, and `copy_to` ({kibana-pull}102280[#102280]).
* Paginates long activity logs ({kibana-pull}102261[#102261]).
* Validates path values for trusted apps ({kibana-pull}99035[#99035]).
* Allows the wildcard symbol in trusted app paths ({kibana-pull}97623[#97623]).
* Adds the option to select all rules within the Rules table that match the currently selected filter ({kibana-pull}100554[#100554]).

[[known-issue-7.14.0]]
==== Known issues
* The {agent} must be upgraded to the newest version to use the Osquery Manager integration in 7.14.0. Upgrade instructions are available at {fleet-guide}/upgrade-elastic-agent.html[Upgrade {agent}] ({kibana-pull}26545[#26545]).
* Customized event rendering settings do not persist on the Alerts page ({kibana-pull}106819[#106819]).
* Fields that have been added to the Alerts table donâ€™t display in the table, but do in the alert details ({kibana-pull}106840[#106840]).
* After upgrading from 7.8 to 7.14, rules sometimes fail to execute, activate, or deactivate. To resolve this, use the <<rules-api-update, PATCH rule API>> to update each rule that encounters this problem. The payload of the PATCH call should set the `author` field to `[]`, as shown in the example below. After the `author` field is populated, the rule works as expected ({kibana-pull}106233[#106233]).
