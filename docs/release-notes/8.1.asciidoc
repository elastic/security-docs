[[known-issue-8.1.3]]
==== Known issues
* A new Lucene 9 validation change may cause event correlation (EQL) rule errors whenever rule queries contain regular expressions using wildcard fields and predefined character classes (for example, `\w`, `\s`, `\d`).

* {endpoint-sec} cannot run on Windows 8.1 or Server 2012 R2 (https://github.com/elastic/endpoint/issues/15[#15]).
* A new Lucene 9 validation change may cause event correlation (EQL) rule errors whenever rule queries contain regular expressions using wildcard fields and predefined character classes (for example, `\w`, `\s`, `\d`).

[[bug-fixes-8.1.1]]
==== Bug fixes and enhancements
* Fixes an {endpoint-sec} integration bug that prevented benign Windows files from being deleted under certain circumstances.
* Adds a notification to the **Exception lists** page that informs users if they are lacking certain role privileges ({kibana-pull}126874[#126874]).
* Turns off the **Upload value lists** option on the **Rules** page if users have `Read` Security privileges only ({kibana-pull}126829[#126829]).
* Removes the option to select rules in the All Rules table if users have `Read` Security privileges only ({kibana-pull}126827[#126827]).

[[known-issue-8.1.0]]
==== Known issues
* An {endpoint-sec} integration bug prevents benign Windows files from being deleted under certain circumstances.
* On macOS versions before 12.4, if {elastic-endpoint} is used with other products that monitor or manage network traffic (such as antivirus programs, firewalls, or VPNs), users might experience network connection issues. To resolve this issue, upgrade to macOS 12.4 or later.
* Indicator match rules cannot use the `.items-*` system index and will encounter execution errors when run. Avoid using indices populated from value lists for indicator match rules ({kibana-pull}133457[#133457]).
* A new Lucene 9 validation change may cause event correlation (EQL) rule errors whenever rule queries contain regular expressions using wildcard fields and predefined character classes (for example, `\w`, `\s`, `\d`).
