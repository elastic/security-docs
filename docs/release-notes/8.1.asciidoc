==== Known issues
* An {endpoint-sec} integration bug prevents benign Windows files from being deleted under certain circumstances.
* On macOS versions before 12.4, if {elastic-endpoint} is used with other products that monitor or manage network traffic (such as antivirus programs, firewalls, or VPNs), users might experience network connection issues. To resolve this issue, upgrade to macOS 12.4 or later.
* Indicator match rules cannot use the `.items-*` system index and will encounter execution errors when run. Avoid using indices populated from value lists for indicator match rules ({pull}133457[#133457]).
