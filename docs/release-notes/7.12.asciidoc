[[known-issues-7.12.0]]
==== Known Issues
* Pagination does not work in the All Cases table. To circumvent this, increase the total number of rows that are displayed per page by selecting an option from the *Rows per page* menu. Alternatively, decrease the number of rows displayed in the table by filtering the list of cases that are returned. Finally, if you know which case you want to view, enter descriptive text about it into the search bar at the top of the table. ({pull}94929[#94929]).
