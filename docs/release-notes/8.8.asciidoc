[[known-issue-8.8.0]]
==== Known issues

* Setting the `max_signals` value higher than the {kibana-ref}/alert-action-settings-kb.html#alert-settings[`xpack.alerting.rules.run.alerts.max`] value will lead to rule failure.
* All field types in the **Fields** browser appear as `unknown`.

[[breaking-changes-8.8.0]]
==== Breaking changes

//tag::breaking-changes[]
// NOTE: The breaking-changes tagged regions are reused in the Elastic Installation and Upgrade Guide. The pull attribute is defined within this snippet so it properly resolves in the output.
// THIS ALSO MEANS IF YOU USE LINKS HERE, THEY SHOULD BE FULL URLS WITH NO ATTRIBUTES
:pull: https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/
* The privileges for attaching alerts to cases have changed. Now, you need at least `Read` privileges for Security and `All` privileges for Cases ({pull}147985[#147985]).
* Adds conditional actions to the rules API. In {elastic-sec} 8.7 and earlier, action frequencies were set on a rule level by defining the `throttle` field. In 8.8 and later, action frequencies are set at the action level, and the `throttle` field is replaced by the `frequency` and `alert_filters` fields. The following APIs are affected:
** https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/8.8/rules-api-get.html[Get rule]
** https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/8.8/rules-api-find.html[Find rules]
** https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/8.8/rules-api-create.html#optional-actions-fields-rule-create[Create rule]
** https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/8.8/rules-api-update.html#optional-actions-fields-rule-update[Update rule]
** https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/8.8/bulk-actions-rules-api.html#optional-actions-fields-bulk-update[Bulk rule actions]

[[deprecations-8.8.0]]
==== Deprecations

* The rule level `throttle` field is deprecated in {elastic-sec} 8.8 and is scheduled for end of life in Q4 of 2024. In {elastic-sec} 8.8 and later, we strongly recommend using the action level `frequency` field to set frequencies for individual rule actions.
