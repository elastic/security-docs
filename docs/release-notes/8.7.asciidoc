==== Known issues
* After upgrading Elastic prebuilt rules, some rules are erroneously duplicated as custom rules. To remove them, go to the Rules page (**Manage** -> **Rules**), click the **Custom rules** filter next to the search bar, then select and delete the duplicate rules. 
* Index aliases and some data streams are not properly retrieved by the {elastic-sec} default data view.   
* The **Add exceptions flyout** loads indefinitely and an out of memory error displays when a rule has a large number of unmapped fields in multiple indices. To avoid this issue, use the <<exceptions-api-overview,exception APIs>> to manage exceptions.
* If you modify an exception item using the <<exceptions-api-update-item,update exception item>> API and _only_ specify its `item_id`, the exception item is erroneously duplicated. To avoid this issue, you can either:

** <<manage-exception,Update exception items>> through the {security-app} UI. 
** Specify an exception item's `item_id` _and_ its `id` when modifying an exception through the <<exceptions-api-update-item,update exception item>> API.

If you've already encountered this issue and want to find erroneously duplicated exceptions, use the queries provided below.

[[bug-fixes-8.7.1]]
==== Bug fixes
* Fixes a bug that caused the {agent} upgrade from 8.6.2 to 8.7.0 to fail for {agents} running the Osquery Manager integration (https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/pull/2448[#2448]).

+

[NOTE]

=====
To prevent upgrade issues while upgrading {agent} from 8.6.2 or 8.7.0, delete the Osquery Manager integration from your {agents} before upgrading them, then re-add it after upgrading. 


If you already upgraded your {agents} and they're stuck in the `Updating` state, you'll need to upgrade them using the API instead of {fleet}. First, remove the Osquery integration from the {agents}, then use the https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/kibana/8.7/x-pack/plugins/fleet/common/openapi/bundled.json#/default/upgrade-agent[Agent upgrade API] to start the upgrade. After the upgrade completes, add the Osquery Manager integration to the {agents} again.

=====


* Fixes a UI bug that affected the rule details page when rules had long queries ({kibana-pull}153338[#153338]).
* Fixes exception operator logic for mapping field conflicts ({kibana-pull}155071[#155071]).
* Fixes a bug that stopped {elastic-defend} from working when malware protection was enabled on Linux hosts.
* Fixes a bug that prevented policy artifacts from being properly updated after being added to the `.fleet-artifacts` index ({kibana-pull}154810[#154810]).
+

[NOTE]

=====
If the error message `Failed to download or validate user artifacts` appears in the Policy Response section of your Elastic Defend integration policy, you can resolve the error by adding the affected endpoint policy artifacts as <<trusted-apps-ov,global trusted applications>>, <<endpoint-rule-exceptions,endpoint exceptions>>, <<event-filters,event filters>>, <<blocklist,blocklist entries>>, or <<host-isolation-exceptions,host isolation exceptions>>. 


To find the affected endpoint policy artifacts:

. Go to *Fleet -> Agent policies*.
. Open the impacted {agent} policy.
. Select *Actions -> View policy*.
. Search for `compression_algorithm: none` in the policy details. This field-value pair will appear under the affected endpoint policy artifacts.

==== Known issues
* After upgrading Elastic prebuilt rules, some rules are erroneously duplicated as custom rules. To remove them, go to the Rules page (**Manage** -> **Rules**), click the **Custom rules** filter next to the search bar, then select and delete the duplicate rules. 
* After alerts are generated for the first time, you may have to refresh your browser before your alert data appears on pages that use data views (for example, Timeline). Navigating between pages will not work (https://github.com/elastic/security-docs/issues/3046[#3046]).


* The {agent} upgrade from 8.6.2 to 8.7.0 might fail for {agents} running the Osquery Manager integration (https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/issues/2433[#2433]). To prevent this, delete the Osquery Manager integration from your {agents} before upgrading them to 8.7.0, then re-add it after upgrading.

If you already upgraded your {agents}, and they're are stuck in the `Updating` state, you'll need to upgrade them using the API instead of {fleet}.

After the upgrade completes, add the Osquery Manager integration to the {agents} again.
+

NOTE: This problem can occur when upgrading {agents} from 8.6.2 or 8.7.0 to any other version. Keep this in mind when upgrading {agents} running 8.6.2 or 8.7.0 to newer versions.

* Enabling malware protection on Linux hosts might cause {elastic-defend} to enter a failed state when mount points are unmounted, which will stop the integration from working. To fix this, turn off <<malware-protection,malware protection>> on the {elastic-defend} integration policy.

* Index aliases and some data streams are not properly retrieved by the {elastic-sec} default data view.   
* The **Add exceptions flyout** loads indefinitely and an out of memory error displays when a rule has a large number of unmapped fields in multiple indices. To avoid this issue, use the <<exceptions-api-overview,exception APIs>> to manage exceptions.
