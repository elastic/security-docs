[[known-issue-8.6.0]]
==== Known issues
* After upgrading Elastic prebuilt rules, some rules are erroneously duplicated as custom rules. To remove them, go to the Rules page (**Manage** -> **Rules**), click the **Custom rules** filter next to the search bar, then select and delete the duplicate rules. 
* When using the Osquery Manager integration with {agent}, Osquery results aren't properly written to {es} and, therefore, cannot be viewed in Kibana (https://github.com/elastic/beats/issues/34250)[#34250]). We recommend that Osquery users skip {stack} version 8.6.0 and upgrade to {stack} version 8.6.1 or later when available.
* Investigation guides for some prebuilt rules may not render correctly if they include an escaped character (such as `\"`). To resolve this, update your prebuilt rules once you receive a rule update prompt on the Rules page (https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/pull/2447[#2447]).
