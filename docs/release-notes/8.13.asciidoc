* Adds field-by-field diffs to the rules upgrade flyout so you can see what's changed between versions ({kibana-pull}174564[#174564]).

==== Bug fixes

* Fixes a bug that prevented the event analyzer preview from loading properly for {esql} rules ({kibana-pull}178389[#178389]).
* Fixes a bug that prevented you from editing, adding, or removing query filters when creating or editing a custom query, indicator match, or new terms rule ({kibana-pull}178207[#178207]).

* Fixes a bug that prevented the **Reset Fields** action on the Alerts table from resetting the table's columns ({kibana-pull}177986[#177986]).
* Fixes a bug that interfered with the rule filtering interface when you opened it from specific parts of {elastic-sec} ({kibana-pull}177946[#177946]).
* Ensures that text within the risk score preview table translates correctly ({kibana-pull}177680[#177680]).

* Fixes a bug that allowed you to add a Timeline as a favorite before it was saved ({kibana-pull}175161[#175161]).
