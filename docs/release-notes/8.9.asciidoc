[[known-issue-8.9.1]]
==== Known issues

* A UI bug can affect the Alerts table height, making it difficult to view alerts. To view alerts, do one of the following:

** Open alerts in Timeline. 
** Adjust the Alerts table size. Do one of the following:

*** Use the **Fields** browser to remove fields from the Alerts table until the table's width is smaller than its container. 
*** Adjust your OS zoom settings and refresh the page.
*** Zoom your browser in and out, then refresh the page. (Row height issues can occur at some zoom levels.)

* Alert table rendering issues occur when threat indicator match alerts contain nested `file.name` values, and the Alerts table displays the `file.name` column. The rendering issues stem from a known bug that occurs when the Alerts table sends a request to the Elasticsearch Fields API (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/97684[#97684]).
+
NOTE: When customizing the Alerts table, avoid adding or displaying fields that also exist as nested properties within any alert documents.

+
The workaround for this issue depends on the types of alerts you want to display. Choose the case that's most relevant to you:

+
**Case #1:** You want to display threat indicator match alerts with nested `file.name` fields but the Alerts table won't render. To fix this, manually edit your browser's local storage and refresh the Alerts page:

+
NOTE: These instructions only apply to the Google Chrome browser. Modify the steps based on of browser you're using.
+

. Right-click anywhere on the Alerts page, then select *Inspect* to open Chrome's Developer Tools.
. Go to *Application -> Storage*, then expand *Local Storage*. 
. Click on the name of your Kibana instance, for example, http://localhost:1234. 
. Search for the `detection-engine-alert-table-securitySolution-rule-details-gridView` key and copy its value. The value you copied is the JSON blob that's used to persist the Alert table's state, including the table's selected columns. 
. Paste the JSON blob into a text file and edit it as follows: 
.. Remove the `id:file.name` string from the `columns` array.  
.. Remove the `file.name` string from the `visibleColumns` array. 
. Go back to Chrome's Developer Tools, and paste the edited JSON into the value for the `detection-engine-alert-table-securitySolution-rule-details-gridView` key.
. Click the *Enter* or *Return* key on your keyboard, and refresh the Alerts page. The Alerts table re-renders without the `file.name` column.
+
NOTE: To avoid further issues, _do not_ re-add the `file.name` field to the table.   

+
**Case #2:** You want to display threat indicator match alerts with nested `file.name` fields and other types of alerts, but the Alerts table is rendering with empty rows. To resolve this issue: 

. Go to the toolbar in the upper-left of the Alerts table, and click *Fields*. 
. Search for the `file.name` field, de-select it, and click *Close*.
. Refresh the Alerts page.

[[known-issue-8.9.0]]
==== Known issues

* On the new Detection rule monitoring dashboard, total `Rule executions` will not always equal the sum of `Succeeded`, `Warning`, and `Failed` executions. This is expected because rules can write multiple statuses per execution. One typical example is gap detection: if a rule detects a gap in rule execution it will write an intermediate `Failed` status, then continue to run, and write a final status (such as `Warning`) before finishing its execution.
* Rule changes can't be saved and existing rule actions are removed if the action's frequency is shorter than the rule's run interval.
* The `upload` response action does not report the correct amount of available disk space. The correct amount is approximately four.
* A UI bug can affect the Alerts table height, making it difficult to view alerts. To view alerts, do one of the following:

** Open alerts in Timeline. 
** Adjust the Alerts table size. Do one of the following:

*** Use the **Fields** browser to remove fields from the Alerts table until the table's width is smaller than its container. 
*** Adjust your OS zoom settings and refresh the page.
