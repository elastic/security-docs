[[known-issue-8.9.0]]
==== Known issues

On the new Detection rule monitoring dashboard, total `Rule executions` will not always equal the sum of `Succeeded`, `Warning`, and `Failed` executions. This is expected because rules can write multiple statuses per execution. One typical example is gap detection: if a rule detects a gap in rule execution it will write an intermediate `Failed` status, then continue to run, and write a final status (such as `Warning`) before finishing its execution.
