==== Known issues

* On the new Detection rule monitoring dashboard, total `Rule executions` will not always equal the sum of `Succeeded`, `Warning`, and `Failed` executions. This is expected because rules can write multiple statuses per execution. One typical example is gap detection: if a rule detects a gap in rule execution it will write an intermediate `Failed` status, then continue to run, and write a final status (such as `Warning`) before finishing its execution.
* Rule changes can't be saved if the rule's action frequency is shorter than the rule's run interval.
* The `upload` response action does not report the correct amount of available disk space. The correct amount is approximately four * A UI bug can affect the Alerts table height, making it difficult to view alerts. To view alerts, do one of the following:

** View the alerts in Timeline. 
** Adjust the Alerts table by doing one of following:

*** Use the **Fields** browser to remove fields from the Alerts table until the table's width is smaller than its container. 
*** Adjust your OS zoom settings and refresh the page.
*** Zoom your browser in and out, then refresh the page. (Row height issues can occur at some zoom levels.)

* Alert table rendering issues occur when threat indicator match alerts contain nested `file.name` values, and the Alerts table displays the `file.name` column. The rendering issues stem from a known bug that occurs when the Alerts table sends a request to the Elasticsearch Fields API (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/97684[#97684]).
+
NOTE: When customizing the Alerts table, avoid adding or displaying fields that also exist as nested properties within any alert documents.

+
The workaround for this issue depends on the types of alerts displayed in the Alerts table. Choose the case and workaround that's most relevant to you:

+
**Case #1:** The Alerts table does not render while attempting to display threat indicator match alerts with nested `file.name` fields. To re-render the Alerts table, manually edit your browser's local storage:

+
NOTE: These instructions apply to the Google Chrome browser. Adjust the steps based on the type of browser you're using.
+

. Inspect the Alerts page to open DevTools.
. Go to *Application -> Storage*, then expand *Local Storage*. 
. Click the name of your Kibana instance, for example, http://localhost:1234. 
. Search for the `detection-engine-alert-table-securitySolution-rule-details-gridView` key and copy the key's value.
+
NOTE: The value you copied is the JSON blob that's used to persist the Alert table's state, including the tables selected columns. 

. Paste the JSON blob into a text file and do both of the following: 
.. Remove the `id:file.name` string from the `columns` array.  
.. Remove the `file.name` string from the `visibleColumns` array. 
. Go back to DevTools and paste the edited JSON into the value for the `detection-engine-alert-table-securitySolution-rule-details-gridView` key.
. Click the *Enter* key on your keyboard and refresh the Alerts page. The Alerts table will re-render correctly and without the `file.name` column.
+
NOTE: To avoid further issues, _do not_ re-add the `file.name` field to the table.   

+
**Case #2:** The Alerts table renders with empty rows as it attempts to display any alert type and threat indicator match alerts with nested `file.name` fields. To resolve this issue: 

. Go to the toolbar in the upper-left of the Alerts table and click *Fields*. 
. Search for the `file.name` field, de-select it, and click *Close*.
. Refresh the Alerts page.

[[bug-fixes-8.9.0]]
==== Bug fixes
* Fixes a bug that prevented rule exceptions from being auto-populated when you created a new exception from an alert's **Take action** menu.
