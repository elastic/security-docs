[[known-issue-8.9.0]]
==== Known issues

* On the new Detection rule monitoring dashboard, total `Rule executions` will not always equal the sum of `Succeeded`, `Warning`, and `Failed` executions. This is expected because rules can write multiple statuses per execution. One typical example is gap detection: if a rule detects a gap in rule execution it will write an intermediate `Failed` status, then continue to run, and write a final status (such as `Warning`) before finishing its execution.
* Rule changes can't be saved if the rule's action frequency is shorter than the rule's run interval.
* The `upload` response action does not report the correct amount of available disk space. The correct amount is approximately four gigabytes.

[[bug-fixes-8.9.0]]
==== Bug fixes
* Fixes a bug that prevented rule exceptions from being auto-populated when you created a new exception from an alert's **Take action** menu.
