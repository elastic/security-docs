[[known-issue-8.3.3]]
==== Known issues
* An {endpoint-cloud-sec} bug on macOS and Linux can cause CPU spikes if malware protection is enabled on an {endpoint-cloud-sec} integration policy. When this happens, {endpoint-cloud-sec} may experience system coverage gaps. To avoid this, we recommend using {agent} version 8.3.2 or earlier. If you are using {agent} version 8.3.3 and have encountered this issue, you can temporarily resolve it by rebooting your computer and disabling <<malware-protection, malware protection>> on your {endpoint-cloud-sec} integration policy (https://github.com/elastic/endpoint/issues/22[#22]).
* A new Lucene 9 validation change may cause event correlation rule (EQL) errors whenever rule queries contain regular expressions using wildcard fields and predefined character classes (for example, `\w`, `\s`, `\d`).

==== Bug fixes and enhancements
* Fixes a bug that prevented the *Create field* button from appearing in the Fields browser when you accessed it from a Timeline created using the Alerts page's *Open in timeline* button ({kibana-pull}135842[#135842]).
* Removes the unsupported `matches` operator from the *Add Rule Exception* flyout ({kibana-pull}136340[#136340]).
* Prevents rule execution log events from being wrongly ordered when the maximum number of events are reached and events are filtered by status ({kibana-pull}131675[#131675]).

[[bug-fixes-8.3.2]]
==== Bug fixes and enhancements
* Allows indices created from value lists to be used with indicator match rules ({kibana-pull}135128[#135128]).
* Fixes an issue where detection rules that were created or edited in 8.2.x failed to execute after you upgraded to {stack} 8.3.0 or 8.3.1 ({kibana-pull}135663[#135663]).

====

[IMPORTANT]

If you already upgraded to 8.3.0 or 8.3.1 and noticed that rules created or updated in 8.2.x were failing with an error similar to the message below, complete the appropriate steps to restore your rules after you upgrade to 8.3.2. Refer to the <<known-issue-8.3.1, known issue section>> of the 8.3.1 release notes for more information.

[[known-issue-8.3.1]]
==== Known issue

*Detection rules stop running after upgrade*

8.3.1 has a bug where detection rules that were created or edited in 8.2.x will stop running after you upgrade. Because of this, we advise against upgrading from 8.2.x to 8.3.1.

If you already upgraded from 8.2.x to 8.3.1, detection rules affected by the bug will have stopped running with an error that is similar to the following example:

[source,text]
----
<rule-type>:<UUID>: execution failed - security_exception: [security_exception] Reason: missing authentication credentials for REST request [/_security/user/_has_privileges], caused by: ""
----

To restore the affected rules and reset their statuses, complete the following.

IMPORTANT: To restore custom and prebuilt rules, you need privileges to <<enable-detections-ui, manage rules>>.


*Restore affected custom and prebuilt rules*

. Go to the Rules page (*Detect -> Rules*).
. Click the *Rows per page* menu under the rules table and select *100 rows*.
. In the rules table, click the *Rule* column to sort by rule name.
. Identify affected rules. They will have a `Failed` status in the *Last response* column.
. Select the affected rules, then click *Bulk actions -> Disable*.
. Select the same rules, then click *Bulk actions -> Enable*.
+
NOTE: After you've re-enabled the affected rules, the rules' *Last Response* values will change to `Pending` and then update to `Active` or `OK`.
+
. Go to the next page of results in the rules table and repeat steps 1 through 6.

*Restore affected custom rules only (optional)*

NOTE: This is an alternative option for users who have only enabled custom rules and/or duplicated and enabled prebuilt rules.

. Go to the *Rules* page (*Detect -> Rules*) and click *Elastic rules*.
. Switch on the *Technical preview* toggle above the table.
. In the rules table, click *Custom rules*.
. Sort the rules table by the *Last Response* column to show the latest rule statuses.
. Select rules with the `Failed` status, then click *Bulk actions -> Tags -> Add Tags*.
. Add a new tag, for example `rules_to_fix`. This will generate new API keys and resolve the bug.
+
On the next scheduled rule execution, the *Last Response* value for the rule will change to `Pending`, and then to `Active` or `OK`.

*The `matches` operator is not supported for rule exceptions*

The `matches` operator in the *Add Rule Exception* flyout does not work because wildcard matches are not supported for rule exceptions. Using the `matches` operator will cause rule exceptions and their associated rules to fail. You can restore failed rules by deleting the unsupported exceptions and refreshing the rules ({kibana-issue}136340[#136340]).

*Lucene 9 validation change might affect event correlation rules*

A new Lucene 9 validation change may cause event correlation rule (EQL) errors whenever rule queries contain regular expressions using wildcard fields and predefined character classes (for example, `\w`, `\s`, `\d`).

[[breaking-changes-8.3.0]]
==== Breaking changes

* Updates Elastic prebuilt {ml} detection rules for some Windows and Linux anomalies with new `v3` {ml} jobs. A confirmation modal is displayed when updating rules if `v1`/`v2` jobs are installed. If you're using 8.2 or earlier versions of {beats} or {agent}, you may need to duplicate prebuilt rules or create new custom rules _before_ you update the prebuilt rules. Once you update the prebuilt rules, they will only use `v3` {ml} jobs. Refer to {security-guide}/alerts-ui-monitor.html#ml-job-compatibility[Troubleshoot missing alerts for machine learning jobs] for more information ({kibana-pull}128334[#128334]).
