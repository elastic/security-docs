[[host-risk-score]]
== Host risk score

NOTE: This page refers to the original user and host risk score modules. If you have the original modules installed, and you're running {stack} version 8.11 or newer, you can <<upgrade-risk-engine, upgrade to the latest risk scoring engine>>.
For information about the latest risk engine, refer to <<entity-risk-scoring, Entity risk scoring>>.

NOTE: This feature is available for {stack} versions 7.16.0 and newer and requires a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum subscription] or higher.

The host risk score feature highlights risky hosts from within your environment. It utilizes a transform with a scripted metric aggregation to calculate host risk scores based on alerts that were generated within the past five days. The transform runs hourly to update the score as new alerts are generated.

Each rule's contribution to the host risk score is based on the rule's risk score (`signal.rule.risk_score`) and a time decay factor to reduce the impact of stale alerts. The risk score is calculated using a weighted sum where rules with higher time-corrected risk scores also have higher weights. Each host risk score is normalized on a scale of 0 to 100.

Specific host attributes can boost the final risk score. For example, alert activity on a server poses a greater risk than that on a laptop. Therefore, the host risk score is 1.5 times higher if the host is a server. This boosted score is finalized after calculating the weighted sum of the time-corrected risks.

The following table shows how risk levels are applied to a host, based on the normalized risk score:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
|Risk level |Host risk score

|Unknown |< 20
|Low |20-40
|Moderate |40-70
|High     | 70-90
|Critical  | > 90

=== Enable host risk score

NOTE: To enable the host risk score feature, you must have alerts in your environment. If you previously enabled host risk score and are upgrading the {stack} to 8.5–8.10, refer to <<upgrade-host-risk-score>>. 

You can enable host risk score from the following places in the  {security-app}:

* The Entity Analytics dashboard 
* The *Host risk* tab on the Hosts page
* The *Host risk* tab on a host's details page

Or, in {kib}, you can enable host risk score in Console. 

To enable host risk score from the Entity Analytics dashboard: 

. In the {security-app}, go to *Dashboards* -> *Entity Analytics*. 
. In the Host Risk Scores section, click *Enable* to install the module. 

To enable host risk score from the Hosts page: 

. Go to *Explore* -> *Hosts*. 
. Select the *Host risk* tab, then click *Enable* to install the module.

image::images/enable-hrs.png[Enable Host Risk Score button]

To enable host risk score from a host's details page: 

. Go to *Explore* -> *Hosts*. 
. Select the *All hosts* tab, then click a host name. 
. On the details page, scroll down to the data tables, then select the *Host risk* tab. 
. Click *Enable* to install the module. 

To enable host risk score from Console in {kib}, open a browser window and enter the following URL:

[source,console]
----------------------------------
{KibanaURL}/s/{spaceID}/app/dev_tools#/console?load_from={KibanaURL}/s/{spaceID}/internal/risk_score/prebuilt_content/dev_tool/enable_host_risk_score
----------------------------------

NOTE: If there's existing content in Console, scroll to the bottom to find the output loaded. 

TIP: If you receive an error message during the installation process, delete the host risk score module manually, then re-enable it. Refer to <<troubleshoot-host-risk-score, Troubleshooting>> for more information. 

[[upgrade-host-risk-score]]
[discrete]
=== Upgrade host risk score 

If you previously enabled host risk score and you're upgrading to {stack} version 8.11 or newer, you can <<upgrade-risk-engine, upgrade to the latest risk scoring engine>>.

Before upgrading, note the following: 

* Since older data is not preserved, previous host risk scores will be deleted, and new scores will be created. However, if you want to retain old host risk scores, you can reindex them _before_ upgrading. To learn how, refer to {ref}/docs-reindex.html[Reindex API]. New data will be stored in the `ml_host_risk_score_<space-id>` and `ml_host_risk_score_latest_<space-id>` indices. 

* You must edit your {cloud}/ec-manage-kibana-settings.html#ec-manage-kibana-settings[{kib} user settings] and remove the `xpack.securitySolution.enableExperimental:['riskyHostsEnabled']` feature flag. 

After this is done, you can proceed with upgrading the host risk score feature from any of the following places in the {security-app}:

* The Entity Analytics dashboard 
* The *Host risk* tab on the Hosts page
* The *Host risk* tab on a host's details page

NOTE: After you enable or upgrade host risk score, you might get a message that says, "No host risk score data available to display." To verify that the transform that installs the host risk score module is picking up data, refer to <<verify-host-risk-score, Verify that host risk score data installed successfully>>.

TIP: If you receive an error message during the upgrade process, delete the host risk score module manually, and then re-enable it. Refer to <<troubleshoot-host-risk-score, Troubleshooting>> for more information. 

[[analyze-host-risk-score]]

=== Analyze host risk score data

It is recommended you analyze hosts with the highest risk scores first -- those in the `Critical` and `Moderate` categories. Host risk score data appears in the following places in the {security-app}:

The `host.risk.calculated_level` column in the Alerts table:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/hrs-alerts-table.png[Host risk score in the Alerts table]

The *Insights* -> *Entities* section on the *Overview* tab within the alert details flyout:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/score-in-flyout.png[Host risk score in alert details flyout,65%]

The *Host risk classification* column in the All hosts table on the Hosts page:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/hrs-all-hosts.png[Host risk score on the Hosts page]

The *Host risk* tab on the Hosts page:

[role="screenshot"]
image::advanced-entity-analytics/images/hosts-hr-data.png[Host risk score on the Hosts page]

The Overview section on the host details page:

[role="screenshot"]

The *Host risk* tab on the host details page:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/hosts-by-risk-details-page.png[Host risk score on the Hosts risk tab]

You can also visualize host risk score data using prebuilt dashboards that are automatically imported when the feature is enabled. 

To access the dashboards:

. In {kib}, go to *Analytics* -> *Dashboard*, then search for `risk score`.
. Select *Drilldown of Host Risk Score* to analyze the risk components of a host, or *Current Risk Score for Hosts* to display a list of current risky hosts in your environment.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/select-hrs-dashboard.png[Select host risk score dashboard]

In this example, we'll explore the *Drilldown of Host Risk Score* dashboard.

[[verify-host-risk-score]]
=== Verify that host risk score data installed successfully (Optional)

After you enable or upgrade host risk score, the following message may appear:  

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/restart-hrs.png[Restart host risk score]

If so, click *Restart* and allow at least an hour for the data to be generated. If data still doesn't appear, verify that host risk score data has been generated:

In {kib}, run the following commands in Console to query the `ml_host_risk_score_<space-id>` index: 

[source,console]
----------------------------------
GET ml_host_risk_score_<space-id>/_search
----------------------------------

If no data returns, you'll need to check if the alerts index (.`alerts-security.alerts-<space-id>`) had alert data when `ml_hostriskscore_pivot_transform_<space-id>` was started.

Example:

[source,console]
----------------------------------
GET transform/ml_hostriskscore_pivot_transform_<space-id>/_stats?human=true
