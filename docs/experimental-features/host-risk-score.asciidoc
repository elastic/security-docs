== Host risk score

NOTE: This feature is available for {stack} versions 7.16.0 and newer.

The host risk score feature highlights risky hosts from within your environment. It utilizes a transform with a scripted metric aggregation to calculate host risk scores based on alerts that were generated within the past five days. The transform runs hourly to update the score as new alerts are generated.

Each rule's contribution to the host risk score is based on the rule's risk score (`signal.rule.risk_score`) and a time decay factor to reduce the impact of stale alerts. The risk score is calculated using a weighted sum where rules with higher time-corrected risk scores also have higher weights. Each host risk score is normalized on a scale of 0 to 100.

Specific host attributes can boost the final risk score. For example, alert activity on a server poses a greater risk than that on a laptop. Therefore, the host risk score is 1.5 times higher if the host is a server. This boosted score is finalized after calculating the weighted sum of the time-corrected risks.

The following table shows how risk levels are applied to a host, based on the normalized risk score:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
|Risk level |Host risk score

|Unknown |< 20
|Low |20-40
|Moderate |40-70
|High     | 70-90
|Critical  | > 90

=== Deploy the host risk score package

To deploy the host risk score framework in your environment, follow https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/docs/experimental-machine-learning/host-risk-score.md[these steps]. To view host risk score data in the {security-app}, you must https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/docs/experimental-machine-learning/host-risk-score.md#8-enable-kibana-features[enable the `riskyHostsEnabled` feature flag]. However, enabling the feature flag is *not* required to view the Lens dashboards.

NOTE: Update host risk score artifacts after you upgrade the {stack}. To do this, download a release bundle that's compatible with the new {stack} version and repeat all the steps referenced above. Failure to do so might cause views in the {security-app} to break.

=== View host risk score data

If the `riskyHostsEnabled` feature flag is enabled:

. In the {security-app}, go to *Dashboards* -> *Overview*, then locate the *Current host risk scores* card in the lower-right corner.
. Click *View dashboard*.

If the `riskyHostsEnabled` feature flag is *not* enabled:

. In {kib}, go to *Analytics -> Dashboard*, then search for "current risk score".
. Select the *Current Risk Score for Hosts* dashboard.

. In the *Current Risk Scores for Hosts* list, hover over the host name to view, click the *+* button, then select *Go to Dashboard*.

TIP: It is recommended you analyze hosts with the highest risk scores -- or those in the `Critical` and `Moderate` categories first.

Use the histogram to track how the risk score for a particular host has changed over time. To specify a date range, use the date and time picker, or drag and select a time range within the histogram.

To go to the host's detail page, left-click any host's corresponding bar in the histogram, then select *Go to Host View*.

The data tables beneath the histogram display associated rules, users, and MITRE ATT&CK tactics of risky hosts. The table data is sorted in reverse chronological order by default, with the highest total risk score at the top. Use this information to triage alerts with the highest risk in your network.
