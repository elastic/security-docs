== Host Risk Score

NOTE: This feature is available for {stack} versions 7.16.0 and newer.

The Host Risk Score feature highlights risky hosts from within your environment. It utilizes a transform with a scripted metric aggregation to calculate host risk scores based on detection rule alerts with an "open" status within a 5-day window. The transform runs hourly to update the score as new detection rule alerts are generated.

The contribution of each rule to the host risk score is calculated as a function of the rule risk score (`signal.rule.risk_score`) and a time decay factor to reduce the contribution of stale alerts, while considering recent alerts. A weighted sum of the individual time-corrected rule risks is then applied to the risk score. As such, rules with a higher time-corrected risk also have a higher weight. Each host risk score is normalized to a scale of 0 to 100.

The following table shows how risk levels are applied to a host, based on the normalized risk score:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
|Risk level |Host Risk Score

|Unknown |< 20
|Low |20-40
|Moderate |40-70
|High     | 70-90
|Critical  | > 90

=== Deploy the Host Risk Score package

To deploy the Host Risk Score framework in your environment, follow https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/docs/experimental-machine-learning/host-risk-score.md[these steps]. These instructions also include steps to enable the `riskyHostsEnabled` feature flag.

NOTE: To view host risk score data on the {elastic-sec} Overview page and the Alert details flyout, you must enable the feature flag. However, enabling the feature flag is NOT required to view the Lens dashboards.

=== View host risk score data

If the `riskyHostsEnabled` feature flag is enabled:

. In the {security-app}, go to the *Overview* page, then locate the *Current host risk scores* card in the lower-right corner.
. Click *View dashboard*.

If the `riskyHostsEnabled` feature flag is NOT enabled:

. In {kib}, go to *Analytics -> Dashboard*.
. Select the *Current Risk Score for Hosts* dashboard.

TIP: It is recommended you analyze hosts with the highest risk scores -- or those in the `Critical` and `Moderate` categories first.

Use the histogram to track how the risk score for a particular host has changed over time. To specify a date range, use the date and time picker or drag and select a time range within the histogram.

To go to the host's detail page, left-click any host's corresponding bar in the histogram, then select *Go to Host View*.

The data tables beneath the histogram display associated rules, users, and MITRE tactics of risky hosts. The table data is sorted in reverse chronological order by default, with the highest total risk score at the top. Use this information to triage alerts that pose the highest risk to your network.

*Host risk score in Alert details flyout*

If the `riskyHostsEnabled` feature flag is enabled, the host risk score keyword is displayed in the *Overview* tab of the Alert details flyout.
