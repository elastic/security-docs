[[host-risk-score]]
== Host risk score

NOTE: This feature is available for {stack} versions 7.16.0 and newer.

The host risk score feature highlights risky hosts from within your environment. It utilizes a transform with a scripted metric aggregation to calculate host risk scores based on alerts that were generated within the past five days. The transform runs hourly to update the score as new alerts are generated.

Each rule's contribution to the host risk score is based on the rule's risk score (`signal.rule.risk_score`) and a time decay factor to reduce the impact of stale alerts. The risk score is calculated using a weighted sum where rules with higher time-corrected risk scores also have higher weights. Each host risk score is normalized on a scale of 0 to 100.

Specific host attributes can boost the final risk score. For example, alert activity on a server poses a greater risk than that on a laptop. Therefore, the host risk score is 1.5 times higher if the host is a server. This boosted score is finalized after calculating the weighted sum of the time-corrected risks.

The following table shows how risk levels are applied to a host, based on the normalized risk score:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
|Risk level |Host risk score

|Unknown |< 20
|Low |20-40
|Moderate |40-70
|High     | 70-90
|Critical  | > 90

=== Deploy host risk score

NOTE: To enable the host risk score feature, you must have alerts in your environment. If you have none, the *Enable via Dev Tools* button will be greyed out.

To deploy the host risk score framework in your environment:

. https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/docs/experimental-machine-learning/host-risk-score.md#8-enable-kibana-features[Enable the `riskyHostsEnabled` feature flag].
. In the {security-app}, go to *Dashboards* -> *Overview*, then locate the *Current host risk scores* card in the lower-right corner.
+

. Click *Enable via Dev Tools*. This will open the Dev Tools Console in {kib}, which will be pre-populated with the scripts required to enable the host risk score feature.
. Click the *Play* button to run each of the scripts, in their numbered order from 1 to 11.

=== Import the host risk score dashboard

After you have set up the framework for the host risk score feature, import pre-built dashboards to analyze risky hosts in your environment:

. Navigate to the *Current host risk scores* card (*Dashboards -> Overview*).
. Click *Import dashboard*.

=== View host risk score data

From the *Current host risk scores* card, click *View dashboard*.

TIP: It is recommended you analyze hosts with the highest risk scores -- or those in the `Critical` and `Moderate` categories first.

Use the histogram to track how the risk score for a particular host has changed over time. To specify a date range, use the date and time picker, or drag and select a time range within the histogram.

To go to the host's detail page, left-click any host's corresponding bar in the histogram, then select *Go to Host View*.

The data tables beneath the histogram display associated rules, users, and MITRE ATT&CK tactics of risky hosts. The table data is sorted in reverse chronological order by default, with the highest total risk score at the top. Use this information to triage alerts with the highest risk in your network.
