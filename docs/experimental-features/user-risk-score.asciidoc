== User risk score

NOTE: This feature is available for {stack} versions 8.3.0 and newer.

The user risk score feature highlights risky usernames from within your environment. It utilizes a transform with a scripted metric aggregation to calculate user risk scores based on alerts  generated within the past 90 days. The transform runs hourly to update the score as new alerts are generated.

Each alert's contribution to the user risk score is based on the alert's risk score (`signal.rule.risk_score`). The risk score is calculated using a weighted sum where rules with higher time-corrected risk scores also have higher weights. Each risk score is normalized on a scale of 0 to 100.

The following table shows how risk levels are applied to a host, based on the normalized risk score:
