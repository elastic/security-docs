== Run Osquery from alerts
Run live queries on hosts associated with alerts to learn more about your infrastructure and operating systems. For example, with Osquery, you can search your system for indicators of compromise that might have contributed to the alert. You can then use this data to inform your investigation and alert triage efforts.
