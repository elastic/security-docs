== Run Osquery from investigation guides
Detection rule investigation guides suggest steps for triaging, analyzing, and responding to potential security issues. When you build a custom rule, you can also set up an investigation guide that incorporates Osquery. This allows you to run live queries from a rule's investigation guide as you analyze alerts produced by the rule.

=== Add live queries to an investigation guide

NOTE: You can only add Osquery to investigation guides for custom rules because prebuilt rules cannot be edited.

. Go to *Rules* -> *Detection rules (SIEM)*, select a rule, then click *Edit rule settings* on the rule details page.
. Select the *About* tab, then expand the rule's advanced settings.
. Scroll down to the Investigation guide section. In the toolbar, click the *Osquery* button (image:images/osquery-button.png[Click the Osquery button,20,20]).
.. Add a descriptive label for the query; for example, `Search for executables`.
.. Select a saved query or enter a new one.
+
TIP: Use <<osquery-placeholder-fields,placeholder fields>> to dynamically add existing alert data to your query. 

.. Expand the **Advanced** section to set a timeout period for the query, and view or set {kibana-ref}/osquery.html#osquery-map-fields[mapped ECS fields] included in the results from the live query (optional).
+
NOTE: Overwriting the query's default timeout period allows you to support queries that take longer to run. The default and minimum supported value for the **Timeout** field is `60`. The maximum supported value is `900`.
