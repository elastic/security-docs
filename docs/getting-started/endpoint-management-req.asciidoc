= Endpoint management requirements

You can create user roles and define privileges to manage feature access in {kib}. This allows you to use the principle of least privilege while managing access to {elastic-defend}'s endpoint management features.

Roles and privileges are configured in *Stack Management* -> *Roles* in {kib}. For more details on using this UI, refer to {kibana-ref}/kibana-role-management.html#adding_kibana_privileges[{kib} privileges].
