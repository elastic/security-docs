= Install {elastic-endpoint} manually

To properly install and configure {elastic-endpoint} manually without a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile, there are additional permissions that must be enabled on the endpoint before {elastic-endpoint} can be fully functional:

* <<system-extension-endpoint, Approve the system extension>>
* <<allow-filter-content, Approve network content filtering>>
* <<enable-fda-endpoint, Enable Full Disk Access>>

NOTE: The following permissions that need to be enabled are required after you <<install-endpoint, configure and install the {elastic-defend} integration>>, which includes <<enroll-security-agent, enrolling the {agent}>>.

[discrete]
[[system-extension-endpoint-ven]]
== Approve the system extension for {elastic-endpoint}

For macOS Catalina (10.15) and later, {elastic-endpoint} will attempt to load a system extension during installation. This system extension must be loaded in order to provide insight into system events such as process events, file system events, and network events.

The following message appears during installation:

--

--

. Click *Open Security Preferences*.
. In the lower-left corner of the *Security & Privacy* pane, click the *Lock button*, then enter your credentials to authenticate.

--

--
+
. Click *Allow* to allow the {elastic-endpoint} system extension to load.

[[allow-filter-content-ven]]
== Approve network content filtering for {elastic-endpoint}

After successfully loading the {elastic-endpoint} system extension,  an additional message appears, asking to allow {elastic-endpoint} to filter network content.

--
image::images/install-endpoint/filter-network-content.png[]
--

* Click *Allow* to enable content filtering for the {elastic-endpoint} system extension. Without this approval, {elastic-endpoint} cannot receive network events and, therefore, cannot enable network-related features such as <<host-isolation-ov, host isolation>>.

[[enable-fda-endpoint-ven]]
== Enable Full Disk Access for {elastic-endpoint}

{elastic-endpoint} requires Full Disk Access to subscribe to system events via the {elastic-defend} framework and to protect your network from malware and other cybersecurity threats. Full Disk Access permissions is a new privacy feature introduced in macOS Mojave (10.14) that prevents some applications from accessing your data. To enable Full Disk Access, you must manually approve {elastic-endpoint}. For endpoints running macOS Mojave (10.14) and earlier, you must also approve the {elastic-endpoint} <<kernel-extension-approval, kernel system extension>>.

NOTE: The following instructions apply only to {elastic-endpoint} running {stack} version 8.0.0 and later. To see Full Disk Access requirements for the Endgame sensor, refer to <<endgame-sensor-full-disk-access>>.

. Open the *System Preferences* application.
. Select *Security and Privacy*.

. From the left pane, select *Full Disk Access*.

image::images/fda/select-fda.png[Select Full Disk Access]
+
. In the lower-left corner of the pane, click the *Lock button*, then enter your credentials to authenticate.
. In the *Privacy* tab,  confirm that `ElasticEndpoint` AND `co.elastic.systemextension` are selected to properly enable Full Disk Access.

If the endpoint is running {stack} version 7.17.0 or earlier:

. In the lower-left corner of the pane, click the *Lock button*, then enter your credentials to authenticate.
. Click the *+* button to view *Finder*.
. Navigate to `/Library/Elastic/Endpoint`, then select the `elastic-endpoint` file.
. Click *Open*.
. In the *Privacy* tab, confirm that `elastic-endpoint` AND `co.elastic.systemextension` are selected to properly enable Full Disk Access.

[[kernel-extension-approval-ven]]
== Approve the kernel extension

For endpoints running macOS Mojave (10.14) and earlier, {elastic-endpoint} will attempt to load a kernel extension (as opposed to a system extension) during installation. This kernel extension is required to provide insight into system events such as process events, file system events, and network events. The following message appears during installation:

--
image::images/fda/sys-ext-blocked.png[System extension blocked]
--

To approve the extension:

. Click *Open Security Preferences.*
. In the lower-left corner of the pane, click the **Lock button**, then enter your credentials to authenticate.
. Click *Allow* to load the kernel extension.
+
--
image::images/fda/allow-kernel-ext.png[Allow kernel extension]
--
+

If the prompt does not appear, enable the extension by doing the following:

. Open a Terminal application.
. Enter `kextload /Library/Extension/kendpoint.kext`. Prepend the command with `sudo` if necessary.
You should receive an output similar to `149    0 0xffffff7f82e7b000 0x21000    0x21000    co.elastic.kendpoint (7.11.0) BD152A57-ABD3-370A-BBE8-D15A0FCBD19A <6 5 2 1>`. If you receive this output, the kernel extension is enabled.
