[[sec-requirements]]
= Elastic Security system requirements

{es-sec} is an inbuilt part of {kib}. To use {es-sec}, you only need an {stack}
deployment (an {es} cluster and {kib}). For information on installing the
{stack}, see
{stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html[Getting started with the {stack}].

The https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix[Support Matrix] page lists officially
supported operating systems, platforms, and browsers on which {es}, {kib}, {beats}, and
Elastic Endpoint have been tested.

[TIP]
==============
Skip installing {es} and {kib} locally and try a
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[cloud deployment],
available on Azure, AWS, and GCP. You can {ess-trial}[try it out for free].
==============

To use {es-sec}, you must have at least the `Read` privilege for the `Security`
feature in the {kib} space (see {kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html[Spaces]).

There are some additional requirements for specific features:

* <<detections-permissions-section>>
* <<case-permissions>>
* <<ml-requirements>>
* <<sensor-full-disk-access, MacOS {es-sec} agent requirements>>
* <<conf-map-ui>>

After your deployment is installed, see <<ingest-data>> for information on how
to ship data to the {stack}.

== Cross-cluster searches

For information on how to perform cross-cluster searches on {es-sec}
indices, see:

* {ref}/modules-cross-cluster-search.html[Search across cluster]
(for on-premises {stack} deployments)
* {cloud}/ec-enable-ccs.html[Enable cross-cluster search] (for hosted deployments)
