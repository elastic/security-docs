[[sec-requirements]]
= Elastic Security system requirements

{es-sec} is an inbuilt part of {kib}. To use {es-sec}, you only need an {stack}
deployment (an {es} cluster and {kib}). For information about installing the 
{stack}, see
{stack-gs}/get-started-elastic-stack.html[Getting started with the {stack}].

[TIP]
==============
Skip installing {es} and {kib} locally and try a
https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service[cloud deployment],
available on Azure, AWS, and GCP. You can {ess-trial}[try it out for free].
==============

There are some additional requirements for using specific features:

* <<detections-permissions, Detections prerequisites>>
* Cases prerequisites
* {ml-cap} job and rule requirements
* Network map requirements
* <<sensor-full-disk-access, MacOS {es-sec} agent requirements>>

// to do: Ben add link
After your deployment is installed, see for information on how
to ship data to the {stack}.

== Cross-cluster searches

For information on how to perform cross-cluster searches on {es-sec}
indices, see:

* {ref}/modules-cross-cluster-search.html[Search across cluster]
(for on-premises {stack} deployments)
* {cloud}/ec-enable-ccs.html[Enable cross-cluster search] (for hosted deployments)
