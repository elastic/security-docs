[[offline-endpoint]]
= Configure offline endpoints and air-gapped environments

By default, {elastic-endpoint} continuously defends against the latest threats by automatically downloading global artifact updates from https://artifacts.security.elastic.co. When running {elastic-endpoint} in a restricted network, you can set up a local mirror server to proxy updates to endpoints that cannot access `elastic.co` URLs directly. 

* If your endpoints cannot access the internet directly, set up a local HTTP mirror server. Refer to <<artifact-mirror>>.
* If your endpoints are running in an air-gapped environment, set up a local HTTP server and manually copy global artifact updates. Refer to <<air-gapped-artifact-server>>.

[[artifact-mirror]]
== Host an {elastic-endpoint} artifact mirror

You can deploy your own {elastic-endpoint} global artifact mirror to enable endpoints to update their global artifacts automatically through another server acting as a proxy. This allows endpoints to get updates even when they can't directly access the internet. 

Complete these steps:

. Deploy an HTTP reverse proxy server.
. Configure {elastic-endpoint} to read from the proxy server.

[discrete]
=== Step 1: Deploy an HTTP reverse proxy server

Set up and configure an HTTP reverse proxy to forward requests to https://artifacts.security.elastic.co and include response headers from the elastic.co server when proxying.

=== Step 2: Configure {elastic-endpoint}

Set the `advanced.artifacts.global.base_url` advanced setting for each <<configure-endpoint-integration-policy,{elastic-defend} integration policy>> that needs to use the mirror. Note that there's a separate setting for each operating system:

* `linux.advanced.artifacts.global.base_url`
* `mac.advanced.artifacts.global.base_url`
* `windows.advanced.artifacts.global.base_url`

[[air-gapped-artifact-server]]
== Host an air-gapped {elastic-endpoint} artifact server

If {elastic-endpoint} needs to operate completely offline in a closed network, you can set up a mirror server and manually update it with new artifact updates regularly.

Complete these steps:

. Deploy an HTTP file server.
. Configure {elastic-endpoint} to read from the file server.
. Manually copy artifact updates to the file server.

[discrete]
=== Step 1: Deploy an HTTP file server

Deploy an HTTP file server to serve files from a local directory, which will be filled with artifact update files in a later step.

[discrete]
=== Step 3: Manually copy artifact updates

Download the most recent artifact files from the Elastic global artifact server, then copy those files to the server instance you created in step 1.

Below is an example script that downloads all the global artifact updates. There are different artifact files for each version of {elastic-endpoint}. Change the value of the `ENDPOINT_VERSION` variable in the example script to match the deployed version of {elastic-endpoint}.

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
export ENDPOINT_VERSION={version} && wget -P downloads/endpoint/manifest https://artifacts.security.elastic.co/downloads/endpoint/manifest/artifacts-$ENDPOINT_VERSION.zip && zcat -q downloads/endpoint/manifest/artifacts-$ENDPOINT_VERSION.zip | jq -r '.artifacts | to_entries[] | .value.relative_url' | xargs -I@ curl "https://artifacts.security.elastic.co@" --create-dirs -o ".@"
----

This command will download files and directory structure that should be directly copied to the file server.

Elastic releases updates continuously as detection engines are improved. Therefore, we recommend updating air-gapped environments at least monthly to stay current with artifact updates.

[discrete]
[[validate-artifact-server]]
== Validate your self-hosted artifact server

Each new global artifact update release increments a version identifier that you can check to ensure that {elastic-endpoint} has received and installed the latest version.

To confirm the latest version of the artifacts for a given {elastic-endpoint} version, check the published version. This example script checks the version:

[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
curl -s https://artifacts.security.elastic.co/downloads/endpoint/manifest/artifacts-{version}.zip | zcat -q | jq -r .manifest_version
----

Replace `https://artifacts.security.elastic.co` in the command above with your local mirror server to validate that the artifacts are served correctly.

After updating the {elastic-endpoint} configuration to read from the mirror server, use {kib}'s {kibana-ref}/discover.html[Discover view] to search the `metrics-*` data view for `endpoint.policy` response documents, then check the installed version (`Endpoint.policy.applied.artifacts.global.version`) and compare with the output from the command above:
