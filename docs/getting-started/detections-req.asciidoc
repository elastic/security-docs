[[detections-permissions-section]]
= Detections prerequisites and requirements

To use the <<detection-engine-overview, Detections feature>>, you first need to
configure a few settings. You also need the https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license] to send
<<rule-notifications, notifications>> when detection alerts are generated.

IMPORTANT: Several steps are *only* required for *self-managed* {stack}
deployments. If you are using an Elastic Cloud deployment, you only need to
<<enable-detections-ui, enable detections>>.

Additionally, there are some <<adv-list-settings, advanced settings>> used to
configure {kib} <<detections-ui-exceptions, value list>> upload limits.

[[detections-on-prem-requirements]]
== Configure self-managed {stack} deployments

These steps are only required for *self-managed* deployments:

* HTTPS must be configured for communication between
{kibana-ref}/configuring-tls.html#configuring-tls-kib-es[{es} and {kib}].
* In the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file, set the
`xpack.security.enabled` setting to `true`. For more information, see
{ref}/settings.html[Configuring {es}] and
{ref}/security-settings.html[Security settings in {es}].
* In the `kibana.yml` {kibana-ref}/settings.html[configuration file], add the
`xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey` setting with any alphanumeric value
of at least 32 characters. For example:
+
`xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey: 'fhjskloppd678ehkdfdlliverpoolfcr'`

IMPORTANT: After changing the `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey` value
and restarting {kib}, you must restart all detection rules.

[[enable-detections-ui]]
== Enable and access detections
To use the Detections page, the Detections feature must be enabled and your role must have access to rules and alerts. If your role does not have the cluster and index privileges needed to enable this feature, you can request someone who has these privileges to visit your Kibana space, which will turn it on for you. The following table describes the required privileges to access the Detections page - including rules and alerts.

NOTE: For instructions about using Machine Learning jobs and rules, refer to <<ml-requirements, Machine learning job and rule requirements>>.

== Enable Detections

To enable the <<detection-engine-overview, Detections feature>>, a user with
these privileges must visit (click on) the *Detections* page:

* The `manage` cluster privilege.
* {kib} space `All` privileges for the `Security` feature (see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges]).
* The `manage`, `write`,`read`, and `view_index_metadata` index privileges for all of these system indices:
** `.siem-signals-<kib-space>`
** `.lists-<kib-space>`
** `.items-<kib-space>`
+
Where `<kib-space>` is the {kib} space name.
* If you want to allow the user to create rules as well as enable the
Detections feature, {kib} space `All` privileges for the `Saved Objects
Management`.

For more information on cluster and index privileges, see
{ref}/security-privileges.html[{es} security privileges].

[TIP]
==============
To create a user who can enable Detections in all {kib} spaces, use glob
patterns. For example, `.siem-signals-*`, `.lists-*`, and `.items-*`.

[[access-detections-ui]]
== Access and use Detections

After enabling Detections, only users with these permissions can view and use rules and alerts on the *Detections* page:

**All**

These permissions are required for both rule and alert management:

* {kib} space with `All` privileges enabled for `Security`.
* The `read`, `write`, `view_index_metadata`, and `maintenance` index privileges for all of these system indices:
** `.siem-signals-<kib-space>`
** `.lists-<kib-space>`
** `.items-<kib-space>`
+
Where `<kib-space>` is the {kib} space name.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/sec-user.png[]

**Rule**

For rule management, make sure {kib} space with `All` privileges is enabled for both `Security` and `Saved Objects Management` features.

**Alert**

If you only want a user to update the status of alerts but not rule, only {kib} space with `All` privileges enabled for `Security` is required.

[[adv-list-settings]]
== Configure list upload limits

You can set limits to the number of bytes and the buffer size used to upload
<<detections-ui-exceptions, value lists>> to {es-sec}.

To set the value:

. Open `kibana.yml` {kibana-ref}/settings.html[configuration file] or edit your
{kib} cloud instance.
. Add any of these settings and their required values:
* `xpack.lists.maxImportPayloadBytes`: Sets the number of bytes allowed for
uploading {es-sec} value lists (default `9000000`, maximum
`100000000`). For every 10 megabytes, it is recommended to have an additional 1
gigabyte of RAM reserved for Kibana.
+
For example, on a Kibana instance with 2 gigabytes of RAM, you can set this value up
to 20000000 (20 megabytes).
* `xpack.lists.importBufferSize`: Sets the buffer size used for uploading
{es-sec} value lists (default `1000`). Change the value if you are
experiencing slow upload speeds or larger than wanted memory usage when
uploading value lists. Set to a higher value to increase throughput at the
expense of using more Kibana memory, or a lower value to decrease throughput and
reduce memory usage.

NOTE: For information on how to configure Elastic Cloud deployments, see
{cloud}/ec-manage-kibana-settings.html[Add Kibana user settings].
