= Detections prerequisites and requirements

To use the <<detection-engine-overview, Detections feature>>, you first need to
configure a few settings. You also need the https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license] to send
<<rule-notifications, notifications>> when detection alerts are generated.

IMPORTANT: Several steps are *only* required for *self-managed* {stack}
deployments. If you're using an Elastic Cloud deployment, you only need to
<<enable-detections-ui, enable detections>>.

Additionally, there are some <<adv-list-settings, advanced settings>> used to
configure {kib} <<value-lists-exceptions, value list>> upload limits.

== Configure self-managed {stack} deployments

These steps are only required for *self-managed* deployments:

* HTTPS must be configured for communication between
{kibana-ref}/configuring-tls.html#configuring-tls-kib-es[{es} and {kib}].
* In the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file, set the
`xpack.security.enabled` setting to `true`. For more information, refer to
{ref}/settings.html[Configuring {es}] and
{ref}/security-settings.html[Security settings in {es}].
* In the `kibana.yml` {kibana-ref}/settings.html[configuration file], add the
`xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey` setting with any alphanumeric value
of at least 32 characters. For example:
+
`xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey: 'fhjskloppd678ehkdfdlliverpoolfcr'`

IMPORTANT: After changing the `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey` value
and restarting {kib}, you must restart all detection rules.

[[enable-detections-ui]]
== Enable and access detections
To use the Detections feature, it must be enabled and your role must have access to rules and alerts. If your role does not have the cluster and index privileges needed to enable this feature, you can request someone who has these privileges to visit your Kibana space, which will turn it on for you. The following table describes the required privileges to access the Detections page, including rules and alerts.

NOTE: For instructions about using Machine Learning jobs and rules, refer to <<ml-requirements, Machine learning job and rule requirements>>.

IMPORTANT: In {stack} version 8.0.0, the `.siem-signals-<space-id>` index was renamed to `.alerts-security.alerts-<space-id>`. Detection alert indices are created for each {kib} space. For the default space, the alerts index is
named `.alerts-security.alerts-default`. If you're upgrading to 8.0.0 or later, users should have privileges for the `.alerts-security.alerts-<space-id>` AND `.siem-signals-<space-id>` indices. If you're newly installing the {stack}, then users do not need privileges for the `.siem-signals-<space-id>` index.

* To provide full access to rule actions and connectors, give your role `All` privileges. With `Read` privileges, you can edit rule actions, but will have limited capabilities to manage connectors. For example, `Read` privileges allow you to add or remove an existing connector from a rule, but does not allow you to create a new connector.

* To import rules with actions, you need at least `Read` privileges for the `Action and Connectors` feature. To overwrite or add new connectors, you need `All` privileges for the `Actions and Connectors` feature. To import rules without actions,  you don't need `Actions and Connectors` privileges.

[[alerting-auth-model]]
=== Authorization

Rules, including all background detection and the actions they generate, are authorized using an {kibana-ref}/api-keys.html[API key] associated with the last user to edit the rule. Upon creating or modifying a rule, an API key is generated for that user, capturing a snapshot of their privileges. The API key is then used to run all background tasks associated with the rule including detection checks and executing actions.

[IMPORTANT]
==============================================
If a rule requires certain privileges to run, such as index privileges, keep in mind that if a user without those privileges updates the rule, the rule will no longer function.

== Configure list upload limits

You can set limits to the number of bytes and the buffer size used to upload
<<value-lists-exceptions, value lists>> to {elastic-sec}.

To set the value:

. Open `kibana.yml` {kibana-ref}/settings.html[configuration file] or edit your
{kib} cloud instance.
. Add any of these settings and their required values:
* `xpack.lists.maxImportPayloadBytes`: Sets the number of bytes allowed for
uploading {elastic-sec} value lists (default `9000000`, maximum
`100000000`). For every 10 megabytes, it is recommended to have an additional 1
gigabyte of RAM reserved for Kibana.
+
For example, on a Kibana instance with 2 gigabytes of RAM, you can set this value up
to 20000000 (20 megabytes).
* `xpack.lists.importBufferSize`: Sets the buffer size used for uploading
{elastic-sec} value lists (default `1000`). Change the value if you're
experiencing slow upload speeds or larger than wanted memory usage when
uploading value lists. Set to a higher value to increase throughput at the
expense of using more Kibana memory, or a lower value to decrease throughput and
reduce memory usage.

NOTE: For information on how to configure Elastic Cloud deployments, refer to
{cloud}/ec-manage-kibana-settings.html[Add Kibana user settings].
