[[detections-permissions-section]]
= Detections prerequisites and requirements

To use the <<detection-engine-overview, Detections feature>>, you need to
configure a few things.

IMPORTANT: There are a number of step that are *only* required for *self-managed*
{stack} deployments. If you are using an Elastic Cloud deployment, you only need to
configure <<enable-detections-ui>> and <<access-detections-ui>>.

Additionally, there are some <<adv-list-settings, advanced settings>> used to
configure {kib} <<detections-ui-exceptions, value list>> upload limits.

You need the https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license] to send
<<rule-notifications, notifications>> when detection alerts are generated.

== Configure self-managed {stack} deployments

These steps are only required for *self-managed* deployments:

* HTTPS must be configured for communication between
{kibana-ref}/configuring-tls.html#configuring-tls-kib-es[{es} and {kib}].
* In the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file, set the
`xpack.security.enabled` setting to `true`. For more information, see
{ref}/settings.html[Configuring {es}] and
{ref}/security-settings.html[Security settings in {es}].
* In the `kibana.yml` {kibana-ref}/settings.html[configuration file], add the
`xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey` setting with any alphanumeric value
of at least 32 characters. For example:
+
`xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey: 'fhjskloppd678ehkdfdlliverpoolfcr'`

IMPORTANT: After changing the `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey` value
and restarting {kib}, you must restart all detection rules.

[[enable-detections-ui]]
== Enable Detections

To enable the <<detection-engine-overview, Detections feature>>, a user with
these privileges must visit (click on) the *Detections* page:

* The `manage` cluster privilege
* {kib} space `All` privileges for the `Security` feature (see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges]).
* The `manage`, `write`,`read`, and `view_index_metadata` index privileges for all of these system indices:
** `.siem-signals-<kib-space>`
** `.lists-<kib-space>`
** `.items-<kib-space>`
+
Where `<kib-space>` is the {kib} space name.
* If you want to allow the user to create rules as well as enable the
Detections feature, {kib} space `All` privileges for the `Saved Objects
Management`.

For more information on cluster and index privileges, see
{ref}/security-privileges.html[{es} security privileges].

[TIP]
==============
To create a user who can enable Detections in all {kib} spaces, use glob
patterns. For example, `.siem-signals-*`, `.lists-*`, and `.items-*`.

spaces:

[[access-detections-ui]]
== Access and use Detections

After enabling Detections, only users with these permission can view and use the
*Detections* page:

* {kib} space `All` privileges for the `Security`  and `Saved Objects
Management` features
* The `read`, `write`, and `view_index_metadata` index privileges for all of these system indices:
** `.siem-signals-<kib-space>`
** `.lists-<kib-space>`
** `.items-<kib-space>`
+
Where `<kib-space>` is the {kib} space name.

spaces:

[[adv-list-settings]]
== Configure list upload limits

You can set limits to the number of bytes and the buffer size used to upload
<<detections-ui-exceptions, values lists>> to {kib}.

To set the value:

. Open `kibana.yml` {kibana-ref}/settings.html[configuration file] or edit your
{kib} cloud instance.
. Add any of these settings and their required values:
* `xpack.lists.maxImportPayloadBytes`: Sets the number of bytes allowed for
uploading Security Solution value lists (default `9000000`, maximum
`100000000`). For every 10 megabytes, it is recommended to have an additional 1
gigabyte of RAM reserved for Kibana.
+
For example, on a Kibana instance with 2 gigabytes of RAM, you can set this value up
to 20000000 (20 megabytes).
* `xpack.lists.importBufferSize`: Sets the buffer size used for uploading
Security Solution value lists (default `1000`). Change the value if you are
experiencing slow upload speeds or larger than wanted memory usage when
uploading value lists. Set to a higher value to increase throughput at the
expense of using more Kibana memory, or a lower value to decrease throughput and
reduce memory usage.

NOTE: For information on how to configure Elastic Cloud deployments, see
{cloud}/ec-manage-kibana-settings.html[Add Kibana user settings].
