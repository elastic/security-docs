[[detections-permissions]]
= Detections prerequisites and requirements

To use the <<detection-engine-overview, Detections feature>>, you need to
configure a few things.

IMPORTANT: There are a number of step that are *only* required for *on-premises*
{stack} deployments. If you are using a cloud deployments, you only need to
configure <<enable-detections-ui>> and <<access-detections-ui>>.

[[detections-on-prem-requirements]]
== Configure on-premises {stack} deployments

These steps are only required for *on-premises* deployments:

* HTTPS must be configured for communication between
{kibana-ref}/configuring-tls.html#configuring-tls-kib-es[{es} and {kib}].
* In the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file, set the 
`xpack.security.enabled` setting to `true`. For more information, see 
{ref}/settings.html[Configuring {es}] and
{ref}/security-settings.html[Security settings in {es}].
* In the `kibana.yml` {kibana-ref}/settings.html[configuration file], add the 
`xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey` setting with any alphanumeric value 
of at least 32 characters. For example:
+
`xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey: 'fhjskloppd678ehkdfdlliverpoolfcr'`

IMPORTANT: After changing the `xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey` value
and restarting {kib}, you must restart all detection rules.

[[enable-detections-ui]]
== Enable Detections

To enable the <<detection-engine-overview, Detections feature>> on all
deployments, a user with these privileges must visit (click on) the *Detections*
page:

* The `manage` cluster privilege
* {kib} space `All` privileges for the `Security` feature (see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges]).
* The `manage`, `write`, and `read` index privileges for all of these system indices:
** `.siem-signals-<kib-space>`
** `.lists-<kib-space>`
** `.items-<kib-space`
+
Where `<kib-space>` is the {kib} space name.

For more information on cluster and index privileges, see
{ref}/security-privileges.html[{es} security privileges].

[TIP]
==============
To create a user who can enable Detections on all {kib} spaces, use a glob
pattern. For example, `.siem-signals-*`, `.lists-*`, and `.items-*`.

[[access-detections-ui]]
== Access and use Detections

After enabling Detections, to view and use the *Detections* page on all
deployments, these permissions are required:

* {kib} space `All` privileges for the `Security`  and `Saved Objects
Management` features
* The `read` and `write` index privileges for all of these system indices:
** `.siem-signals-<kib-space>`
** `.lists-<kib-space>`
** `.items-<kib-space`
+
Where `<kib-space>` is the {kib} space name.

TIP: To enable autocomplete for rule queries when creating or modifying
detection rules, add `read` privileges for all `securitySolution:defaultIndex`
indices (*{kib}* -> *Stack Management* -> *Advanced Settings* ->
*`securitySolution:defaultIndex`*).

spaces:
