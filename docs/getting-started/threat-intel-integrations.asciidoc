[[es-threat-intel-integrations]]
= Enable threat intelligence integrations

The Threat Intelligence view gives you a streamlined way to collect threat intelligence data that you can use for threat detection and matching. You can connect to threat intelligence sources using an <<agent-ti-integration, {agent} integration>>, the <<ti-mod-integration, Threat Intel module>>, or a <<custom-ti-integration, custom integration>>.

NOTE: The warning message about remaining threat intelligence sources is removed once you’ve enabled all available {elastic-sec} threat intelligence integrations.

[[agent-ti-integration]]
== Enable an {agent} integration

To set up an {agent} integration:

. Install a {fleet-guide}/install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent.html[{fleet} managed {agent}] on the servers you want to monitor.
. In the Threat Intelligence view, click *Enable sources*.
. Select and integration, and complete the installation steps.
. Return to the Threat Intelligence view on the Overview page. Refresh the page if indicator data isn't displaying.

[[ti-mod-integration]]
== Enable a Threat Intel module integration

To set up an integration through the Threat Intel module:

. Set up the {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-installation-configuration.html[{filebeat} agent] and enable the Threat Intel module.
+
NOTE: For more information about enabling available threat intelligence filesets, refer to {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-threatintel.html[Threat Intel module].

. Update the `securitySolution:defaultThreatIndex` <<update-threat-intel-indices, advanced setting>> by adding the appropriate index pattern name after the default {fleet} threat intelligence index pattern (`logs-ti*`):
.. If you're using {filebeat} version 8.x _only_, add the appropriate {filebeat} threat intelligence index pattern, for example, `filebeat-8*` or `filebeat*`.
.. If you're using a previous version of Filebeat _and_ a current one, differentiate between the threat intelligence indices by using unique index pattern names. For example, if you’re using {filebeat} version 7.0.0 and 8.0.0, add `filebeat-7*` and `filebeat-8*`.
. Return to the Threat Intelligence view on the Overview page. Refresh the page if indicator data isn't displaying.

[float]
[[custom-ti-integration]]
== Enable a custom integration

To enable a custom integration:

. Set up a way to <<ingest-data, ingest data>> into your system.
. Update the Threat indices advanced setting by adding the appropriate index pattern name after the default {fleet} threat intelligence index pattern (`logs-ti*`), for example, `custom-ti-index*`.
+
NOTE: Threat intelligence indices aren’t required to be ECS compatible. However, we recommend compatibility if you’d like for your alerts to be enriched with relevant threat indicator information. You can find a list of ECS compliant threat intelligence fields at {ecs-ref}/ecs-threat.html[Threat Fields] and {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-threatintel.html[Threat Intel module]. 

. Return to the Threat Intelligence view on the Overview page. Refresh the page if indicator data isn't displaying.
+
NOTE: The Threat Intelligence view looks for a `threat.feed.name` field value to define the source name. If a custom source doesn't have the `threat.feed.name` field, or hasn't defined a `threat.feed.name` field value, it's named *Other*. Dashboards links are not created for sources in the *Other* category unless the source has the `threat.feed.dashboard_id` field defined.
