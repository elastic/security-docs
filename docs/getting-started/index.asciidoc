= Get started with Elastic Security

Looking to get started with Elastic Security? This section describes the Elastic Security UI in Kibana, the system requirements required to run the {agent} with the Elastic {endpoint-sec} integration, and instructions on how to configure and install Elastic Security on your host.

TIP: View the https://www.elastic.co/training/elastic-security-quick-start[Elastic Security Quick Start video] to learn how to configure your endpoints with Elastic Security so you can stream, detect, and visualize threats in real time on Elastic Cloud.
