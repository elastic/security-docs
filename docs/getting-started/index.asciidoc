= Get started with {elastic-sec}

Looking to get started with {elastic-sec}? This section describes the {elastic-sec} UI in {kib}, the system requirements required to run the {agent} with the {elastic-defend} integration, and instructions on how to configure and install {elastic-sec} on your host.

TIP: View the https://www.elastic.co/training/elastic-security-quick-start[{elastic-sec} Quick Start video] to learn how to configure your endpoints with {elastic-sec} so you can stream, detect, and visualize threats in real time on {ecloud}.
