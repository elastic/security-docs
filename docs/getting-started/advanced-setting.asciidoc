[[advanced-settings]]
= Configure advanced settings

The advanced settings determine:

* Which indices {es-sec} uses to retrieve data
* {ml-cap} anomaly score display threshold
* The navigation menu style used throughout the {security-app}
* Whether the news feed is displayed on the <<overview-ui>>
* The default time interval used to filter {es-sec} pages
* The default {es-sec} pages refresh time
* Which IP reputation links appear on <<network-page-overview, IP detail>>
pages
* Whether cross-cluster search (CCS) privilege warnings are displayed
* Whether related integrations are displayed on the Rules page tables

You need `All` privileges for the *Advanced Settings* feature to change these
settings (refer to {kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[Kibana privileges]).

WARNING: Modifying advanced settings can affect Kibana performance and cause
problems that are difficult to diagnose. Setting a property value to a blank
field reverts to the default behavior, which might not be compatible with other
configuration settings. Deleting a custom setting removes it from Kibana
permanently.

[[update-sec-indices]]
== Update default Elastic Security indices

The `securitySolution:defaultIndex` field defines which {es} indices the
{es-sec-app} uses to collect data. By default, these index patterns are used to
match {es} indices:

* `apm-*-transaction*`
* `auditbeat-*`
* `endgame-*`
* `filebeat-*`
* `logs-*`
* `packetbeat-*`
* `winlogbeat-*`

NOTE: Index patterns use wildcards to specify a set of indices. For example, the
`filebeat-*` index pattern means all indices starting with `filebeat-` are
available in the {es-sec-app}.

All of the default index patterns match {beats-ref}/beats-reference.html[{beats}] and
{fleet-guide}/fleet-overview.html[{agent}] indices. This means all
data shipped via {beats} and the {agent} is automatically added to the
{es-sec-app}.

You can add or remove any indices and index patterns as required. For background information on {es} indices, refer to {ref}/documents-indices.html[Data in: documents and indices].

NOTE: If you leave the `logs-*` index selected, by default, all Elastic cloud logs are excluded from all queries in the {security-app}. This is to avoid adding data from cloud monitoring to the app.

IMPORTANT: {es-sec} requires {ecs-ref}[ECS-compliant data]. If you use third-party data
collectors to ship data to {es}, the data must be mapped to ECS.
<<siem-field-reference>> lists ECS fields used in {es-sec}.

[[update-threat-intel-indices]]
== Update default Elastic Security threat intelligence indices

The `securitySolution:defaultThreatIndex` advanced setting specifies threat intelligence indices that {elastic-sec} features query for ingested threat indicators. This setting affects features that query threat intelligence indices, such as the Threat Intelligence view on the Overview page, indicator match rules, and the alert enrichment query. You can specify one or more threat intelligence indices; multiple indices must be separated by commas. By default, only the `logs-ti*` index pattern is specified. Do not remove or overwrite this index pattern, as it is used by {agent} integrations.

IMPORTANT: Threat intelligence indices aren't required to be ECS-compatible for use in indicator match rules. However, we strongly recommend compatibility if you want your alerts to be enriched with relevant threat indicator information. When searching for threat indicator data, indicator match rules use the threat indicator path specified in the *Indicator prefix override* advanced setting. Visit <<rule-ui-advanced-params, Configure advanced rule settings>> for more information.

[[telemetry-settings]]
== Telemetry settings

Kibana transmits certain information about Elastic Security when users interact with the {security-app}, detailed below. {kib} redacts or obfuscates personal data (IP addresses, host names, usernames, etc.) before transmitting messages to Elastic. Security-specific telemetry events include:

* *Detection rule security alerts:* Information about Elastic-authored prebuilt detection rules using the detection engine. Examples of alert data include machine learning job influencers, process names, and cloud audit events.
* *{elastic-endpoint} Security alerts:* Information about malicious activity detected using {elastic-endpoint} detection engines. Examples of alert data include malicious process names, digital signatures, and file names written by the malicious software. Examples of alert metadata include the time of the alert, the {elastic-endpoint} version and related detection engine versions.
* *Configuration data for {elastic-endpoint}:* Information about the configuration of {elastic-endpoint} deployments. Examples of configuration data include the Endpoint versions, operating system versions, and performance counters for Endpoint.
* *Exception list entries for Elastic rules:* Information about exceptions added for Elastic rules. Examples include trusted applications, detection exceptions, and rule exceptions.
* *Security alert activity records:* Information about actions taken on alerts generated in the {security-app}, such as acknowledged or closed.

To learn more, refer to our https://www.elastic.co/legal/privacy-statement[Privacy Statement].

== Set machine learning score threshold

When security <<machine-learning, {ml} jobs>> are enabled, this setting
determines the threshold above which anomaly scores appear in {es-sec}:

* `securitySolution:defaultAnomalyScore`

[discrete]
== Enable grouped navigation

The `securitySolution:enableGroupedNav` setting enables the grouped navigation menu for {elastic-sec}, which groups related pages and highlights commonly visited areas for a streamlined experience.

By default, the {security-app} uses the legacy navigation menu; turn on `securitySolution:enableGroupedNav` to use the grouped navigation menu.

[discrete]
== Modify news feed settings

You can change these settings, which affect the news feed displayed on the
{es-sec} *Overview* page:

* `securitySolution:enableNewsFeed`: Enables the security news feed on the
Security *Overview* page.
* `securitySolution:newsFeedUrl`: The URL from which the security news feed content is
retrieved.

[discrete]
== Change the default search interval and data refresh time

These settings determine the default time interval and refresh rate {es-sec}
pages use to display data when you open the app:

* `securitySolution:timeDefaults`: Default time interval
* `securitySolution:refreshIntervalDefaults`: Default refresh rate

NOTE: Refer to {ref}/common-options.html[Date Math] for information about the
syntax. The UI {kibana-ref}/set-time-filter.html[time filter] overrides the
default values.

[discrete]
[[ip-reputation-links]]
== Display reputation links on IP detail pages

On IP details pages (*Security* -> *Network* -> IP address), links to
external sites for verifying the IP address's reputation are displayed. By
default, links to these sites are listed: https://talosintelligence.com/[TALOS]
and https://www.virustotal.com/[VIRUSTOTAL].

The `securitySolution:ipReputationLinks` field determines which IP reputation
sites are listed. To modify the listed sites, edit the field's JSON array. These
fields must be defined in each array element:

* `name`: The link's UI display name.
* `url_template`: The link's URL. It can include `{{ip}}`, which is placeholder
for the IP address you are viewing on the *IP detail* page.

*Example*

Adds a link to \https://www.dnschecker.org on *IP detail* pages:

[source,json]
--------------------------------------------------
[
  { "name": "virustotal.com", "url_template": "https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/{{ip}}" },
  { "name": "dnschecker.org", "url_template": "https://www.dnschecker.org/ip-location.php?ip={{ip}}" },
  { "name": "talosIntelligence.com", "url_template": "https://talosintelligence.com/reputation_center/lookup?search={{ip}}" }
]
--------------------------------------------------

[[enable-ccs-warning]]
== Configure cross-cluster search privilege warnings

Each time a detection rule runs using a remote cross-cluster search (CCS) index pattern, it will return a warning saying that the rule may not have the required `read` privileges to the remote index. Because privileges cannot be checked across remote indices, this warning displays even when the rule actually does have `read` privileges to the remote index.

If you've ensured that your detection rules have the required privileges across your remote indices, you can use the `securitySolution:enableCcsWarning` setting to disable this warning and reduce noise.

[discrete]
[[show-related-integrations]]
== Show/hide related integrations in Rules page tables

By default, Elastic prebuilt rules in the *Rules* and *Rule Monitoring* tables include a badge showing how many related integrations have been installed. Turn off `securitySolution:showRelatedIntegrations` to hide this in the rules tables (related integrations will still appear on rule details pages).
