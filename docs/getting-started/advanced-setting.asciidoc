[[advanced-settings]]
= Configure advanced settings

The advanced settings determine:

* Which indices {es-sec} uses to retrieve data
* Whether the news feed is displayed on the <<overview-ui>>
* The default time interval used to filter {es-sec} pages
* The default {es-sec} pages refresh time
* {ml-cap} anomaly score display threshold
* Which IP reputation links appear on <<network-page-overview, IP detail>>
pages

You need `All` privileges for the *Advanced Settings* feature to change these
settings (see {kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[Kibana privileges]).


WARNING: Modifying advanced settings can affect Kibana performance and cause
problems that are difficult to diagnose. Setting a property value to a blank
field reverts to the default behavior, which might not be compatible with other
configuration settings. Deleting a custom setting removes it from Kibana
permanently.

[[update-sec-indices]]
== Update default Elastic Security indices

The `securitySolution:defaultIndex` field defines which {es} indices the
{es-sec-app} uses to collects data. By default, these index patterns are used to
match {es} indices:

* `apm-*-transaction*`
* `auditbeat-*`
* `endgame-*`
* `filebeat-*`
* `logs-*`
* `packetbeat-*`
* `winlogbeat-*`

NOTE: Index patterns use wildcards to specify a set of indices. For example, the
`filebeat-*` index pattern means all indices starting with `filebeat-` are
available in the {es-sec-app}.

All of the default index patterns match {beats-ref}/beats-reference.html[{beats}] and
{fleet-guide}/fleet-overview.html[{agent}] indices. This means all
data shipped via {beats} and the {agent} is automatically added to the
{es-sec-app}.

You can add or remove any indices and index patterns as required. For some
background information on {es} indices, see
{ref}/documents-indices.html[Data in: documents and indices].

NOTE: If you leave the `logs-*` index selected, by default, all Elastic cloud logs are excluded from all queries in the {security-app}. This is to avoid adding data from cloud monitoring to the app.

IMPORTANT: {es-sec} requires {ecs-ref}[ECS-compliant data]. If you use third-party data
collectors to ship data to {es}, the data must be mapped to ECS.
<<siem-field-reference>> lists ECS fields used in {es-sec}.

[discrete]
== Modify news feed settings

You can change these settings, which affect the news feed displayed on the
{es-sec} *Overview* page:

* `securitySolution:enableNewsFeed`: Enables the security news feed on the
Security *Overview* page.
* `securitySolution:newsFeedUrl`: The URL from which the security news feed content is
retrieved.

[discrete]
== Change the default search interval and data refresh time

These settings determine the default time interval and refresh rate {es-sec}
pages use to display data when you open the app:

* `securitySolution:timeDefaults`: Default time interval
* `securitySolution:refreshIntervalDefaults`: Default refresh rate

NOTE: See {ref}/common-options.html[Date Math] for information about the
syntax. The UI {kibana-ref}/set-time-filter.html[time filter] overrides the
default values.

[discrete]
== Set machine learning score threshold

When security <<machine-learning, {ml} jobs>> are enabled, this setting
determines the threshold above which anomaly scores are displayed in {es-sec}:

* `securitySolution:defaultAnomalyScore`

[discrete]
[[ip-reputation-links]]
== Display reputation links on IP detail pages

On IP details pages (*Security* -> *Network* -> IP address), links to
external sites for verifying the IP address's reputation are displayed. By
default, links to these sites are listed: https://talosintelligence.com/[TALOS]
and https://www.virustotal.com/[VIRUSTOTAL].

The `securitySolution:ipReputationLinks` field determines which IP reputation
sites are listed. To modify the listed sites, edit the field's JSON array. These
fields must be defined in each array element:

* `name`: The link's UI display name.
* `url_template`: The link's URL. It can include `{{ip}}`, which is placeholder
for the IP address you are viewing on the *IP detail* page.

*Example*

Adds a link to \https://www.dnschecker.org on *IP detail* pages:
