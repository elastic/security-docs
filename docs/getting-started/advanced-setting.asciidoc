[[advanced-settings]]
= Configure advanced settings

The advanced settings determine:

* Which indices {es-sec} uses to retrieve data
* Whether the news feed is displayed on the <<overview-ui>>
* The default time interval used to filter {es-sec} pages
* The default {es-sec} pages refresh time
* {ml-cap} anomaly score display threshold
* Which IP reputation links appear on <<network-page-overview, IP detail>>
pages

You need `All` privileges for the *Advanced Settings* feature to change these
settings (see {kibana-ref}/kibana-privileges.html[Kibana privileges]).


WARNING: Modifying advanced settings can affect Kibana performance and cause
problems that are difficult to diagnose. Setting a property value to a blank
field reverts to the default behavior, which might not be compatible with other
configuration settings. Deleting a custom setting removes it from Kibana
permanently.

[[update-sec-indices]]
== Update default Elastic Security indices

The `securitySolution:defaultIndex` field defines which {es} indices the
{es-sec-app} uses to collects data. By default, these index patterns are used to
match {es} indices:

* `apm-*-transaction*`
* `auditbeat-*`
* `endgame-*`
* `filebeat-*`
* `logs-*`
* `packetbeat-*`
* `winlogbeat-*`

NOTE: Index patterns use wildcards to specify a set of indices. For example, the
`filebeat-*` index pattern means all indices starting with `filebeat-` are
available in the {es-sec-app}.

All of the default index patterns match {beats-ref}/beats-reference.html[{beats}] and
{fleet-guide}/fleet-overview.html[{agent}] indices. This means all
data shipped via {beats} and the {agent} is automatically added to the
{es-sec-app}.

You can add or remove any indices and index patterns as required. For some
background information on {es} indices, see
{ref}/documents-indices.html[Data in: documents and indices].

NOTE: If you leave the `logs-*` index selected, by default, all Elastic cloud logs are excluded from all queries in the {security-app}. This is to avoid adding data from cloud monitoring to the app.

IMPORTANT: {es-sec} requires {ecs-ref}[ECS-compliant data]. If you use third-party data
collectors to ship data to {es}, the data must be mapped to ECS.
<<siem-field-reference>> lists ECS fields used in {es-sec}.

[[update-threat-intel-indices]]
== Update default Elastic Security threat intelligence indices

The `securitySolution:defaultThreatIndex` advanced setting defines threat intelligence indices that {elastic-sec} will use when collecting threat indicators. The setting controls features that query threat indices, such as the Threat Intelligence view on the Overview page and threat indicator match rules. One or more threat intelligence indices can be defined; the `filebeat-*` index is specified by default.

IMPORTANT: Threat intelligence indices aren't required to be ECS compatible when used in an indicator match rule. However, we recommend compatibility if you'd like for your alerts to be enriched with relevant threat indicator information. By default, indicator match rules are configured to ingest indicators from the Threat Intel {filebeat} module and to check for fields prefixed with `threatintel.indicator`. See {filebeat-ref}/filebeat-module-threatintel.html[Threat Intel module] for more information about these fields. This rule setting is stored in the *Indicator prefix override* field, under indicator match rule advanced settings. If your indicator data contains indicator fields at a different location, update this field accordingly to ensure alert enrichment can still be performed.

[[telemetry-settings]]
== Telemetry settings

Kibana transmits certain information about Elastic Security when users interact with the Elastic Security app, detailed below. Kibana redacts Personal Data (IP addresses, host names, usernames, etc) before transmitting messages to Elastic. Security-specific telemetry events include:

* *Elastic Endpoint Security alerts:* Information about malicious activity detected using Elastic Endpoint detection engines. Examples of alert data include malicious process names, digital signatures, and file names written by the malicious software. Examples of alert metadata include the time of the alert, the version of Elastic Endpoint and related detection engine versions.
* *Configuration data for Elastic Endpoint:* Information about the configuration of Elastic Endpoint deployments. Examples of configuration data include the Endpoint versions, operating system versions, and performance counters for Endpoint.
Configuration Data for Elastic Rules: this information includes the names of Elastic rules that are enabled.
* *Exceptionlist entries for Elastic rules:* This information includes exceptions added for Elastic rules. Examples include Endpoint trusted applications, Endpoint detection exceptions, and Elastic rule exceptions.

To learn more, see our https://www.elastic.co/legal/privacy-statement[Privacy Statement].


[discrete]
== Modify news feed settings

You can change these settings, which affect the news feed displayed on the
{es-sec} *Overview* page:

* `securitySolution:enableNewsFeed`: Enables the security news feed on the
Security *Overview* page.
* `securitySolution:newsFeedUrl`: The URL from which the security news feed content is
retrieved.

[discrete]
== Change the default search interval and data refresh time

These settings determine the default time interval and refresh rate {es-sec}
pages use to display data when you open the app:

* `securitySolution:timeDefaults`: Default time interval
* `securitySolution:refreshIntervalDefaults`: Default refresh rate

NOTE: See {ref}/common-options.html[Date Math] for information about the
syntax. The UI {kibana-ref}/set-time-filter.html[time filter] overrides the
default values.

[discrete]
== Set machine learning score threshold

When security <<machine-learning, {ml} jobs>> are enabled, this setting
determines the threshold above which anomaly scores are displayed in {es-sec}:

* `securitySolution:defaultAnomalyScore`

[discrete]
[[ip-reputation-links]]
== Display reputation links on IP detail pages

On IP details pages (*Security* -> *Network* -> IP address), links to
external sites for verifying the IP address's reputation are displayed. By
default, links to these sites are listed: https://talosintelligence.com/[TALOS]
and https://www.virustotal.com/[VIRUSTOTAL].

The `securitySolution:ipReputationLinks` field determines which IP reputation
sites are listed. To modify the listed sites, edit the field's JSON array. These
fields must be defined in each array element:

* `name`: The link's UI display name.
* `url_template`: The link's URL. It can include `{{ip}}`, which is placeholder
for the IP address you are viewing on the *IP detail* page.

*Example*

Adds a link to \https://www.dnschecker.org on *IP detail* pages:
