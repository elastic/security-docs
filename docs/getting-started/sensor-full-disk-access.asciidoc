= Enable full disk access

Elastic Endpoint Security requires full disk access to protect you from malware and other cybersecurity threats. Full Disk Access permissions is a new privacy feature introduced in macOS Mojave (10.14) that prevents some applications from accessing your data. This means you need to manually grant permission for Elastic Endpoint Security to access these protected areas of your Mac.

This article describes how to enable full disk access for both the Elastic Agent, required in order to enable Elastic Endpoint Security, and the legacy Endgame sensor.

NOTE: The `elastic-endpoint` file for Endpoint Security only appears after you've downloaded the {agent} with the Endpoint Secrutiy Integration. For more information, <<install-endpoint,Configure and install Endpoint Security>>. 

1. Open the **System Preferences** application.
+
2. Click **Security and Privacy**. On the Security and Privacy panel, select the **Privacy** tab.

3. In the left pane, select **Full Disk Access**.

4. In the lower-left corner of the panel, click the **Lock button** and enter your username and password. You can now add the `elastic-endpoint` or `esensor` file.

5. Click the + button to view Finder. Select the file that pertains most to your Endpoint configuration: 
+
- Endpoint Security: Navigate to the directory where you downloaded your `elastic-agent` file and select that file.
+
- Elastic Endgame: Navigate to `/Library/Endgame` and select the `esensor` file.

6. After you've selected the applicable file, click **Open**. This gives Elastic Security full disk access. 

7. In the **Privacy** tab, confirm that the `elastic-agent` or `esensor` file appears in the list of applications that have full access permission.


Elastic Endpoint Security now has the access required to fully protect your system.
