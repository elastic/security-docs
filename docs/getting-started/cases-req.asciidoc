:frontmatter-description: Learn about the {kib} feature privileges required to access {elastic-sec} cases. 
:frontmatter-tags-products: [security]
:frontmatter-tags-content-type: [how-to] 
:frontmatter-tags-user-goals: [configure]

//To view cases, you need the {kib} space `Read` privilege for the `Security` feature. To create cases and add comments, you need the `All` {kib}
//space privilege for the `Security` feature.

//For more information, see
//{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges].

You can create roles and define feature privileges at different levels to manage feature access in {kib}. {kib} privileges grant access to features within a specified {kib} space, and you can grant full or partial access. For more information, see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges].

[NOTE]
====
To send cases to external systems, you need the {subscriptions}[appropriate license].

If you are using an on-premises {kib} deployment and want the email
notifications and the external incident management systems to contain links back
to {kib}, you must configure the 
{kibana-ref}/settings.html#server-publicBaseUrl[server.publicBaseUrl] setting.
====

IMPORTANT: Certain subscriptions and privileges might be required to manage case attachments. For example, to add alerts to cases, you must have privileges for <<enable-detections-ui,managing alerts>>. 

To grant access to cases, set the {kib} space privileges for the *Cases* and *{connectors-feature}* features as follows:

[discrete]
[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================

| Action      | {kib} Privileges
| Give full access to manage cases and settings
a|
* **All** for the *Cases* feature under *Security*
* **All** for the *{connectors-feature}* feature under *Management*

[NOTE]
====
Roles without **All** privileges for the *{connectors-feature}* feature cannot create, add, delete, or modify case connectors.

By default, **All** for the *Cases* feature allows you to delete cases, delete alerts and comments from cases, and edit case settings. You can customize the sub-feature privileges to limit feature access.
====

| Give assignee access to cases
a| **All** for the *Cases* feature under *Security*

NOTE: Before a user can be assigned to a case, they must log into {kib} at least
once, which creates a user profile.

| Give view-only access for cases
a| **Read** for the *Security* feature and **All** for the *Cases* feature

NOTE: You can customize the sub-feature privileges to allow access to deleting cases, deleting alerts and comments from cases, and viewing or editing case settings.

| Revoke all access to cases | **None** for the *Cases* feature under *Security*
