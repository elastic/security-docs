= Cases prerequisites

To view cases, you need the {kib} space `Read` privilege for the `Security` feature. To create cases and add comments, you need the `All` {kib}
space privilege for the `Security` feature.

For more information, see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges].

NOTE: To send cases to external systems, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license].

You can create roles and define feature privileges at different levels to manage feature access in {kib}. {kib} privileges grant access to features within a specified {kib} space and full or partial access can be given.

When setting up feature access to Cases, you can configure the following:

- Base privileges for the {es-sec} solution
- Sub-feature privileges for the Cases feature (toggle *Customize sub-feature privileges* to use this optional setting)
- Privileges for actions and connectors

NOTE: Privileges set at the sub-feature level will override base privileges for the {es-sec} solution. In other words, the Cases feature takes on the base privileges of the {es-sec} solution unless configured otherwise. For example, a role with `Read` base privileges only can view {es-sec} features and artifacts (including Cases) within the {es-sec} app  but can't modify them. However, setting the role's sub-feature Case privileges to `All` allows the role to view and manage Cases only.

More information about the minimum privileges needed to use Cases is below:
