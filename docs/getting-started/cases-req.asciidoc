//To view cases, you need the {kib} space `Read` privilege for the `Security` feature. To create cases and add comments, you need the `All` {kib}
//space privilege for the `Security` feature.

//For more information, see
//{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges].

You can create roles and define feature privileges at different levels to manage feature access in {kib}. {kib} privileges grant access to features within a specified {kib} space, and you can grant full or partial access. For more information, see
{kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html#spaces-control-user-access[Feature access based on user privileges].

NOTE: To send cases to external systems, you need the
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[appropriate license].

notifications and the external incident management systems to contain links back

{kibana-ref}/settings.html#server-publicBaseUrl[server.publicBaseUrl] setting.

To grant access to cases, set the {kib} space privileges for the *Cases* and *{connectors-feature}* features as follows:
