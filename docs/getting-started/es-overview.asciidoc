= Elastic Security overview

Elastic Security combines the threat detection of SIEM and the prevention, detection, and response of Endpoint Security via an autonomous agent into a unified software solution. These analytical and protection capabilities, leveraged by the speed and extensibility of Elasticsearch enables analysts to defend their organization from threats before damage and loss occur.

Elastic Security provides the following security benefits and capabilities:

* A powerful detection engine to identify attacks and system misconfiguration
* Powerful visualizations to investigate attacks
* Accelerated response with embedded case management and automated actions
* Detection of signatureless attacks with machine learning and technique-based methods
* Prebuilt anomaly detection jobs and detection rules


The following diagram provides a comprehensive illustration of the Elastic Security workflow.
