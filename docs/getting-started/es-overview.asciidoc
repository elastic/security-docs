= Elastic Security overview

Elastic Security combines the threat detection of SIEM and the prevention, detection, and response of Endpoint Security via an autonomous agent into a unified software solution. These analytical and protection capabilities, leveraged by the speed and extensibility of Elasticsearch enables analysts to defend their organization from threats before damage and loss occur.

Elastic Security provides the following security benefits and capabilities:

* Advanced endpoint detection, prevention, and response for continuous protection across MITRE ATT&CK®
* A powerful rules engine to collect events and generate external alerts for system health monitoring
* Visualized event analysis that shows a timeline of events that occurred before and after an attempted attack
* Accelerated response with embedded case management and automated actions
* Detection of signatureless attacks with machine learning and technique-based methods
* Prebuilt anomaly detection jobs and detection rules
* Creation of exception lists to minimize false positives
