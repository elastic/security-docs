== {es} resource guidelines

Follow these guidelines to ensure clusters have adequate memory to handle data volume:

* With 2GB of Java Virtual Machine (JVM) heap memory, the risk scoring task can safely process around 44 million documents (30 days of risk data with an ingest rate of 1000 documents per minute).

* With 1GB of JVM heap, the risk scoring task can safely process around 20 million documents (30 days of risk data with an ingest rate of around 450 documents per minute).

== Known limitations

* You can only enable the risk scoring engine in a single {kib} space within a cluster.

* The risk scoring engine uses the internal {kib} user to score all hosts and users. This means the scoring task does not respect custom user or role permissions. All alerts from the configured {kib} space will contribute to the entity's risk.
