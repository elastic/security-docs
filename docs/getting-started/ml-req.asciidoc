[[ml-requirements]]
= Machine learning job and rule requirements

To run and create {ml} jobs and rules, you need all of these:

* The {subscriptions}[appropriate license]
* There must be at least one {ml} node in your cluster
* The `machine_learning_admin` user role

For more information, go to {ml-docs}/setup.html[Set up {ml-features}].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `machine_learning_admin` and `machine_learning_user` built-in roles give
access to the results of _all_ {anomaly-jobs}, irrespective of whether the user
has access to the source indices. Likewise, a user who has full or read-only
access to {ml-features} within a given {kib} space can view the results of _all_
{anomaly-jobs} that are visible in that space. You must carefully consider who
is given these roles and feature privileges; {anomaly-job} results may propagate
field values that contain sensitive information from the source indices to the
results.
