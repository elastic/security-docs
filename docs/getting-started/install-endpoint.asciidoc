= Configure and install Elastic Endpoint Integration (beta)

beta[]


Like other Elastic integrations, Elastic Endpoint Security can be integrated into the Elastic Agent through {fleet-guide}/ingest-management-overview.html[Ingest Manager]. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor for events on your host and send data to the Elastic Security app.

NOTE: Configuring the Endpoint Integration on the Elastic Agent requires that the user have permission to use Ingest Manager in Kibana.

[[configure-malware]]
== Configure malware protection settings

After you have installed the agent, malware prevention is automatically enabled on protected hosts. If needed, you can configure malware protection settings to meet your company's security needs.

1. In the security app, select the **Admin** tab to view the Administration page. Remember that you must have admin permissions in {kib} to access this page.
2. From the **Integration** column, select the integration you want to configure. The Host Configuration page appears.
3. By default, the **Malware Protection Enabled** toggle is on. To disable malware protection, switch the toggle off. Malware protection levels are as follows:
* **Detect**: Detects malware on the host and generates an alert. When set to detect, the agent will **not** block malware. You must pay attention to and analyze any malware alerts that are generated.
* **Prevent** (Default): Detects malware on the host, blocks it from executing, and generates an alert.
4. Click **Save** to save changes to the integration.
5. On the dialog box that says, "Saving these changes will apply updates to number endpoints assigned to this agent policy," click **Save and Deploy changes**. If successful, a "Success" confirmation appears in the lower right corner.
