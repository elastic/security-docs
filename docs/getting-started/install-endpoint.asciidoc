= Configure and install Elastic Endpoint Security (beta)

beta[]


Like other Elastic integrations, Elastic Endpoint Security can be integrated into the Elastic Agent through {ingest-guide}/ingest-management-overview.html[Ingest Manager]. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor for events on your host and send data to the Elastic Security app.

NOTE: Configuring the Endpoint Integration on the Elastic Agent requires that the user have permission to use Ingest Manager in Kibana.

4. After the Elastic Agent is installed on your host machine, open a command-line interface, and navigate to your Agent's directory. Copy the commands from Ingest Manager for your OS to enroll and run the Agent.

After you have enrolled the Elastic Agent on your host, select **Continue**. The host now appears on the Hosts view page inside the Elastic Security app.

[discrete]
=== Standalone mode

If you want to manage the Elastic Agent without using Fleet to manage your hosts, you can enroll the Agent on your host in {ingest-guide}/ingest-management-getting-started.html#agent-standalone-mode.

1. In the Add agent pane, select the **Standalone mode** tab.
2. Download the Elastic Agent on your host's machine and select an agent configuration.
3. In the installed Agent's directory, create a file named `elastic-agent.yml`. Copy your configuration into the file from Step 3 of the Add agent pane. Remember to modify `ES_USERNAME` and `ES_PASSWORD` in the `outputs` section with your Elastic username and password.
4. Save the file and start the Agent using `./elastic-agent run` for your OS.
5. Once the Agent begins to send data, verify that the data is viewable in Kibana by going to **Ingest Manager** > **Datasets**.
