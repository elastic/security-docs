= Configure and install the Endpoint Security integration

Like other Elastic integrations, Endpoint Security can be integrated into the Elastic Agent through {fleet-guide}/fleet-overview.html[{fleet}]. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor for events on your host and send data to the {security-app}.

NOTE: To configure the Endpoint Security integration on the {agent}, you must have permission to use {fleet} in {kib}. You must also have admin permissions in {kib} to access the **Endpoints** page in the {security-app}.

[[enroll-security-agent]]
== Configure and enroll the Elastic Agent

To configure the {agent}, Endpoint Security requires enrollment through Fleet to enable the integration.

IMPORTANT: Before you add an {agent}, a {fleet-server} must be running. See {fleet-guide}/fleet-server.html#add-fleet-server[Add a {fleet-server}].

[discrete]
[[fleet-server-upgrade]]
=== Important information about the new {fleet-server}

NOTE: If you are running an {stack} version earlier than 7.13.0, you can skip this section.

If you have upgraded to an {stack} version that includes the new {fleet-server} (>=7.13.0), you will need to redeploy your agents. Review the following scenarios to ensure you take the appropriate steps.

* If you redeploy the {agent} to the same machine through the {fleet} application after you upgrade, a new agent will appear.
* If you want to remove the {agent} entirely without transitioning to the {fleet-server}, then you will need to manually uninstall the agent on the machine. This will also uninstall the endpoint. See {fleet-guide}/uninstall-elastic-agent.html[Uninstall Elastic Agent].
* In the rare event that the {agent} fails to uninstall, you might need to manually uninstall the endpoint. See <<uninstall-endpoint, Uninstall an endpoint>> at the end of this topic.

NOTE: Endpoint Security cannot be integrated with an {agent} in Standalone mode.

1. Go to *{fleet}* -> *Agents* -> **Add agent**.

[[enable-kernel-extension]]
== Enable Elastic Endpoint kernel

If you are running the {agent} with the {elastic-endpoint} integrated on macOS 10.13, 10.14 and 10.15, you will be prompted to approve a kernel extension from "Endgame, Inc". To approve the extension:

1. Select **Open Security Preferences**. The **Security and Privacy** pane opens.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/install-endpoint/system-extension.png[macOS notification with Open Security Preferences button highlighted.]
+
2. Select the **Lock** icon at the bottom left of the window to make changes to your security settings.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/install-endpoint/unlock-security-panel.png[Detail of Security and Privacy pane with Lock icon highlighted.]
+
3. Allow "Endgame, Inc" by clicking the **Allow** button.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/install-endpoint/allow-endgame.png[Security and Privacy pane with Allow button highlighted.]

TIP: Endgame Sensor users can approve the kernel the same way for the **Elastic Endgame** app.

If the prompt does not appear because you're using a version earlier than macOS Big Sur (11.0), enable the extension by doing the following:

1. Open a Terminal application.
2. Enter `kextload /Library/Extension/kendpoint.kext`. Prepend the command with `sudo` if necessary.
3. To confirm the kernel extension has loaded, enter `kextstat | grep co.elastic.kendpoint`.
4. You should receive an output similar to `149    0 0xffffff7f82e7b000 0x21000    0x21000    co.elastic.kendpoint (7.11.0) BD152A57-ABD3-370A-BBE8-D15A0FCBD19A <6 5 2 1>`. If you receive this output, the kernel extension is enabled.

[[configure-security-policy]]
== Configure an Integration policy (optional)

After the {agent} is installed successfully, malware prevention and ransomware prevention (a Platinum+ license feature) are automatically enabled on protected hosts. If needed, you can update the Integration policy to configure malware protection, ransomware protection, event collection, and antivirus settings to meet your company's security needs.

To access the Integration policy:

1. In the {security-app}, go to **Manage** -> **Endpoints** to view the Endpoints list. Remember that you must have admin permissions in {kib} to access this page.
2. From the **Policy** column, select the policy you want to configure. The integration policy configuration page appears.
3. Review the policy settings below and configure as appropriate:
* <<malware-protection>>
* <<ransomware-protection>>
* <<memory-protection>>
* <<behavior-protection>>
* <<event-collection>>
* <<register-as-antivirus>>
* <<adv-policy-settings>>
* <<save-policy>>

[discrete]
[[malware-protection]]
=== Malware protection

Malware prevention on the {agent} detects and stops malicious attacks by using a <<machine-learning-model, machine learning model>> that looks for static attributes to determine if a file is malicious or benign.

By default, malware protection is enabled on Windows, macOS, and Linux hosts. To disable malware protection, switch the **Malware protections enabled** toggle off. 

Malware protection levels are:

* **Detect**: Detects malware on the host and generates an alert. The agent will **not** block malware. You must pay attention to and analyze any malware alerts that are generated. Notifications do not appear by default. Select the **Notify User** option to enable them.
* **Prevent** (Default): Detects malware on the host, blocks it from executing, and generates an alert. Notifications appear by default. Deselect the **Notify User** option to disable them.
+
TIP: Platinum and Enterprise customers can customize these notifications using the `Elastic Security {action} {filename}` syntax.

[discrete]
[[ransomware-protection]]
=== Ransomware protection

Behavioral ransomware prevention detects and stops ransomware attacks on Windows systems by analyzing data from low-level system processes. It is effective across an array of widespread ransomware families — including those targeting the system’s master boot record.

Ransomware protection is a paid feature and is enabled by default if you have a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or Enterprise license]. If you upgrade to a Platinum+ license from Basic or Gold, ransomware protection will be disabled by default.

Ransomware protection levels are:

* **Detect**: Detects ransomware on the host and generates an alert. The {agent} will **not** block ransomware. Select the **Notify User** option to enable user notifications.
* **Prevent** (Default): Detects ransomware on the host, blocks it from executing, and generates an alert. User notifications are enabled by default. Deselect the **Notify User** option to disable them.
+
TIP: Platinum and Enterprise customers can customize these notifications using the `Elastic Security {action} {filename}` syntax.

[discrete]
[[memory-protection]]
=== Memory threat protection

Memory threat protection detects and stops in-memory threats on Windows systems, such as shellcode injection, which are used to evade traditional file-based detection techniques.

Memory threat protection is a paid feature and is enabled by default if you have a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or Enterprise license]. If you upgrade to a Platinum+ license from Basic or Gold, memory threat protection will be disabled by default.

Memory threat protection levels are:

* **Detect**: Detects memory threat activity on the host and generates an alert. The {agent} will **not** block the in-memory activity. Select the **Notify User** option to enable user notifications.
* **Prevent** (Default): Detects memory threat activity on the host, forces the process or thread to stop, and generates an alert. User notifications are enabled by default. Deselect the **Notify User** option to disable them.
+
TIP: Platinum and Enterprise customers can customize these notifications using the `Elastic Security {action} {rule}` syntax.

[discrete]
[[behavior-protection]]
=== Malicious behavior protection

Malicious behavior protection detects and stops threats by monitoring the behavior of system processes for suspicious activity. Behavioral signals are much more difficult for adversaries to evade than traditional file-based detection techniques.

Malicious behavior protection is a paid feature and is enabled by default if you have a https://www.elastic.co/pricing[Platinum or Enterprise license]. If you upgrade to a Platinum+ license from Basic or Gold, malicious behavior protection will be disabled by default.

Malicious behavior protection levels are:

* **Detect**: Detects malicious behavior on the host and generates an alert. The {agent} will **not** block the malicious behavior. Select the **Notify User** option to enable user notifications.
* **Prevent** (Default): Detects malicious behavior on the host, forces the process to stop, and generates an alert. User notifications are enabled by default. Deselect the **Notify User** option to disable them.
+
TIP: Platinum and Enterprise customers can customize these notifications using the `Elastic Security {action} {rule}` syntax.
