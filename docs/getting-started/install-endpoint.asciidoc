= Configure and install Elastic Endpoint Integration (beta)

beta[]


Like other Elastic integrations, Endpoint Security can be integrated into the Elastic Agent through {fleet-guide}/fleet-overview.html[{fleet}]. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor for events on your host and send data to the Elastic Security app.

NOTE: Configuring the Endpoint Integration on the Elastic Agent requires that the user have permission to use {fleet} in Kibana.

4. After the {agent} is installed on your host machine, open a command-line interface, and navigate to your Agent's directory. Copy the commands from Fleet for your OS to enroll and run the Agent.

After you have enrolled the {agent} on your host, select **Continue**. The host now appears in the Endpoints list, located on the Administration page in the {security-app}.

To unenroll an agent from your host, see {fleet-guide}/unenroll-elastic-agent.html[Unenroll Elastic Agent].

[[enable-kernel-extension]]
== Enable Elastic Endpoint kernel

When running the {agent} with endpoint integrated on macOS 10.13, 10.14 and 10.15, you will be prompted to approve a kernel extension from "Endgame, Inc". To approve the extension:

TIP: Endgame Sensor users can approve the kernel the same way for the **Elastic Endgame** app.

If the prompt does not appear because you're using a version before macOS Big Sur (11.0), enable the extension by:

1. Open a Terminal application.
2. Enter `kextload /Library/Extension/kendpoint.kext`. Prepend the command with `sudo` if necessary.
3. Confirm the kernel extension has loaded, enter `kextstat | grep co.elastic.kendpoint`.
4. You should receive and output similar to `149    0 0xffffff7f82e7b000 0x21000    0x21000    co.elastic.kendpoint (7.9.0) BD152A57-ABD3-370A-BBE8-D15A0FCBD19A <6 5 2 1>`.

[[configure-malware]]
== Configure malware protection settings

After you have installed the agent, malware prevention is automatically enabled on protected hosts. If needed, you can configure malware protection settings to meet your company's security needs.

1. In the security app, select the **Administration** tab to view the Endpoints list. Remember that you must have admin permissions in {kib} to access this page.
2. From the **Integration Policy** column, select the Policy you want to configure. The Integration Policy page appears.
3. By default, the **Malware Protections Enabled** toggle is on. To disable malware protection, switch the toggle off. Malware protection levels are as follows:
* **Detect**: Detects malware on the host and generates an alert. The agent will **not** block malware. You must pay attention to and analyze any malware alerts that are generated.
* **Prevent** (Default): Detects malware on the host, blocks it from executing, and generates an alert.
4. Click **Save** to save changes to the Policy.
5. On the dialog that appears, click **Save and Deploy changes**. If successful, a "Success" confirmation appears in the lower-right corner.
