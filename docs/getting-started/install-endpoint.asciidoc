= Configure and install the Endpoint Security integration

Like other Elastic integrations, Endpoint Security can be integrated into the Elastic Agent through {fleet-guide}/fleet-overview.html[{fleet}]. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor for events on your host and send data to the {security-app}.

NOTE: To configure the Endpoint Security integration on the {agent}, you must have permission to use {fleet} in {kib}. You must also have admin permissions in {kib} to access the **Endpoints** page in the {security-app}.

[[security-before-you-begin]]
== Before you begin

If you're using macOS, some versions may require you to grant Full Disk Access to different kernels, system extensions, or files. Refer to <<deploy-elastic-endpoint, requirements for {elastic-endpoint}>> if you're installing the {elastic-endpoint} or <<endgame-sensor-full-disk-access, requirements for the Endgame sensor>> for more information.

[[add-security-integration]]

. Configure the Endpoint Security integration with an **Integration name** and optional **Description**.
. Enter a name for the agent policy in **New agent policy name**. If other agent policies already exist, you can click the **Existing hosts** tab and select an existing policy instead. For more details on {agent} configuration settings, refer to {fleet-guide}/agent-policy.html[{agent} policies]. 
. When the configuration is complete, click **Save and continue**.
. To complete the integration, continue to the next section to install the {agent} on your hosts.

[[enroll-security-agent]]
== Configure and enroll the {agent}

To configure the {agent}, Endpoint Security requires enrollment through Fleet to enable the integration.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
Before you add an {agent}, a {fleet-server} must be running. Refer to {fleet-guide}/add-a-fleet-server.html[Add a {fleet-server}].

Endpoint Security cannot be integrated with an {agent} in Standalone mode.

[[fleet-server-upgrade]]
=== Important information about {fleet-server}

NOTE: If you are running an {stack} version earlier than 7.13.0, you can skip this section.

If you have upgraded to an {stack} version that includes {fleet-server} (>=7.13.0), you will need to redeploy your agents. Review the following scenarios to ensure you take the appropriate steps.

* If you redeploy the {agent} to the same machine through the {fleet} application after you upgrade, a new agent will appear.
* If you want to remove the {agent} entirely without transitioning to the {fleet-server}, then you will need to manually uninstall the {agent} on the machine. This will also uninstall the endpoint. Refer to {fleet-guide}/uninstall-elastic-agent.html[Uninstall Elastic Agent].
* In the rare event that the {agent} fails to uninstall, you might need to manually uninstall the endpoint. Refer to <<uninstall-endpoint, Uninstall an endpoint>> at the end of this topic.

. Select an agent policy for the {agent}. You can select an existing custom policy, or select **Create new agent policy** to create a new one. For more details on {agent} configuration settings, refer to {fleet-guide}/agent-policy.html[{agent} policies].
+
The selected policy should include {endpoint-sec}.

. Download and extract the {agent} package on your host's machine.

. Open a command-line interface and navigate to the directory where the {agent} is located. Copy and run the command from {fleet} for your OS to enroll and run the agent.

. After you have enrolled the {agent} on your host, select **Close**. The host now appears on the **Endpoints** page in the {security-app}. It may take a minute or two while the {agent} starts up.

For macOS, continue with <<deploy-elastic-endpoint, these instructions>> to grant {elastic-endpoint} the access it needs.
