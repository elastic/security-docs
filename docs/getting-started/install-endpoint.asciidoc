= Install and configure the Endpoint Security integration

Like other Elastic integrations, Endpoint Security can be integrated into the Elastic Agent through {fleet-guide}/fleet-overview.html[{fleet}]. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor for events on your host and send data to the {security-app}.

NOTE: To configure the Endpoint Security integration on the {agent}, you must have permission to use {fleet} in {kib}. You must also have admin permissions in {kib} to access the **Endpoints** page in the {security-app}.

[[security-before-you-begin]]
== Before you begin

If you're using macOS, some versions may require you to grant full disk access to different kernels, system extensions, or files. See <<sensor-full-disk-access>> for more information.

[[add-security-integration]]
== Add the Endpoint Security integration

. In {kib}, select **Security** -> **Endpoints**. If this is not your first time using {es-sec}, select **Management** -> **Integrations**, then search for and select **Endpoint Security**.

. Select **Add Endpoint Security** on either the Endpoints page of the {security-app} or the Endpoint Security integration page (*Management* -> *Integrations*). The integration configuration page appears.

. Configure the Endpoint Security integration with a name and optional description. 
. Select an agent policy for the {agent}. You can select the default policy, an existing custom policy, or select **Create agent policy** to create a new one. For more details on {agent} configuration settings, see {fleet-guide}/agent-policy.html[{agent} policies].
. When the configuration is complete, click **Save and continue**.
. To complete the integration, continue to the next section to install the {agent} on your hosts.

[[enroll-security-agent]]
== Configure and enroll the Elastic Agent

To configure the {agent}, Endpoint Security requires enrollment through Fleet to enable the integration.

IMPORTANT: Before you add an {agent}, a {fleet-server} must be running. See {fleet-guide}/add-a-fleet-server.html[Add a {fleet-server}].

[[fleet-server-upgrade]]
=== Important information about the new {fleet-server}

NOTE: If you are running an {stack} version earlier than 7.13.0, you can skip this section.

If you have upgraded to an {stack} version that includes the new {fleet-server} (>=7.13.0), you will need to redeploy your agents. Review the following scenarios to ensure you take the appropriate steps.

* If you redeploy the {agent} to the same machine through the {fleet} application after you upgrade, a new agent will appear.
* If you want to remove the {agent} entirely without transitioning to the {fleet-server}, then you will need to manually uninstall the agent on the machine. This will also uninstall the endpoint. See {fleet-guide}/uninstall-elastic-agent.html[Uninstall Elastic Agent].
* In the rare event that the {agent} fails to uninstall, you might need to manually uninstall the endpoint. See <<uninstall-endpoint, Uninstall an endpoint>> at the end of this topic.

NOTE: Endpoint Security cannot be integrated with an {agent} in Standalone mode.

1. Go to *{fleet}* -> *Agents* -> **Add agent**.

+
2. In the Add agent pane, download the {agent} on your host's machine.
3. After the download is complete, select the **Endpoint Security** integration.
+

+
4. After the {agent} is installed on your host machine, open a command-line interface and navigate to the directory where the agent is located. Copy the commands from {fleet} for your OS to enroll and run the agent.
+
5. After you have enrolled the {agent} on your host, select **Close**. The host now appears on the **Endpoints** page in the {security-app}.

[[enable-kernel-extension]]
== Enable Elastic Endpoint kernel

If you are running the {agent} with the {elastic-endpoint} integrated on macOS 10.13, 10.14 and 10.15, you will be prompted to approve a kernel extension from "Endgame, Inc". To approve the extension:

1. Select **Open Security Preferences**. The **Security and Privacy** pane opens.
+
[role="screenshot"]
image::images/install-endpoint/system-extension.png[macOS notification with Open Security Preferences button highlighted.]
+
2. Select the **Lock** icon at the bottom left of the window to make changes to your security settings.
+

+
3. Allow "Endgame, Inc" by clicking the **Allow** button.

TIP: Endgame Sensor users can approve the kernel the same way for the **Elastic Endgame** app.

If the prompt does not appear because you're using a version earlier than macOS Big Sur (11.0), enable the extension by doing the following:

1. Open a Terminal application.
2. Enter `kextload /Library/Extension/kendpoint.kext`. Prepend the command with `sudo` if necessary.
3. To confirm the kernel extension has loaded, enter `kextstat | grep co.elastic.kendpoint`.
4. You should receive an output similar to `149    0 0xffffff7f82e7b000 0x21000    0x21000    co.elastic.kendpoint (7.11.0) BD152A57-ABD3-370A-BBE8-D15A0FCBD19A <6 5 2 1>`. If you receive this output, the kernel extension is enabled.

[[configure-security-policy]]
== Configure an integration policy (optional)

After the {agent} is installed with the {endpoint-sec} integration, several protections features — including preventions against malware, ransomware, memory threats, and malicious behavior — are automatically enabled on protected hosts (a Platinum or Enterprise license feature). If needed, you can update the integration policy to configure protection settings, event collection, antivirus settings, and trusted applications to meet your organization's security needs.

See <<configure-endpoint-integration-policy>> for more information on configuring these settings in an {endpoint-sec} integration policy.
