= Configure and install Elastic Endpoint Integration (beta)

beta[]


Like other Elastic integrations, Elastic Endpoint Security can be integrated into the Elastic Agent through {ingest-guide}/ingest-management-overview.html[Ingest Manager]. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor for events on your host and send data to the Elastic Security app.

NOTE: Configuring the Endpoint Integration on the Elastic Agent requires that the user have permission to use Ingest Manager in Kibana.

[[configure-malware]]
== Configure malware protection settings

After you have installed the agent, malware prevention is automatically enabled on protected hosts. If needed, you can configure malware protection settings to meet your company's security needs.

1. In the security app, select the **Administration** tab to view the Endpoints list. Remember that you must have admin permissions in {kib} to access this page.
2. From the **Integration Policy** column, select the Policy you want to configure. The Integration Policy page appears.
3. By default, the **Malware Protections Enabled** toggle is on. To disable malware protection, switch the toggle off. Malware protection levels are as follows:
* **Detect**: Detects malware on the host and generates an alert. The agent will **not** block malware. You must pay attention to and analyze any malware alerts that are generated.
* **Prevent** (Default): Detects malware on the host, blocks it from executing, and generates an alert.
4. Click **Save** to save changes to the Policy.
5. On the dialog that appears, click **Save and Deploy changes**. If successful, a "Success" confirmation appears in the lower-right corner.
