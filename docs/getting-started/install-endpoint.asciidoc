= Configure and install Elastic Endpoint Integration (beta)

Like other Elastic integrations, Elastic Endpoint Security can be integrated into the Elastic Agent through {ingest-guide}/ingest-management-overview.html[Ingest Manager]. Upon configuration, the integration allows the Elastic Agent to monitor for events on your host and send data to the Elastic Security app.

NOTE: Configuring the Endpoint Integration on the Elastic Agent requires that the user have permission to use Ingest Manager in Kibana.

[[configure-malware]]
== Configure Malware detect or prevent

After you have created an agent, you can configure malware protection on protected hosts. Malware is enabled by default and set to **Protect**.

1. In the security app, go to the **Administration** page. Remember that you must have the proper permissions to access this page.
2. From the **Integration** column, select the host name that you want to configure. The host administration page appears.
3. Make sure that the **Malware Protection Enabled** toggle is on. Once toggled, select the one of the following protection levels:
a. **Detect**: Detects malware on the host and generates an alert. When set to detect, the agent itself will **not** block malware. You must pay attention to and analyze the alerts coming in yourself. The agent itself will **not** block malware when set 
b. **Prevent**: Detects malware on the host, blocks it from executing, and generates an alert.
