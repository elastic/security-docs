[[install-endpoint]]
= Configure and install the {elastic-defend} integration

Like other Elastic integrations, {elastic-defend} can be integrated into the {agent} using {fleet-guide}/fleet-overview.html[{fleet}]. Upon configuration, the integration allows the {agent} to monitor for events on your host and send data to the {security-app}.

NOTE: To configure the {elastic-defend} integration on the {agent}, you must have permission to use {fleet} in {kib}. You must also have admin permissions in {kib} to access the **Endpoints** page in the {security-app}.

[[security-before-you-begin]]
== Before you begin

If you're using macOS, some versions may require you to grant Full Disk Access to different kernels, system extensions, or files. Refer to <<deploy-elastic-endpoint, requirements for {elastic-endpoint}>> if you're installing the {elastic-endpoint} or <<endgame-sensor-full-disk-access, requirements for the Endgame sensor>> for more information.

[[add-security-integration]]
== Add the {elastic-defend} integration

. Go to the *Integrations* page, which you can access in several ways:

* In {kib}: *Management* -> *Integrations*
* In the {security-app}: *Security homepage* -> *Add security integrations*

. Search for and select *{elastic-defend}*, then select *Add {elastic-defend}*. The integration configuration page appears.

image::images/install-endpoint/endpoint-cloud-security-configuration.png[Add {elastic-defend} integration page,75%]
+
. Configure the {elastic-defend} integration with an **Integration name** and optional **Description**.
. Select the type of environment you want to protect, either *Traditional Endpoints* or *Cloud Workloads*.
. Next, select a configuration preset. Each preset comes with different default settings for {agent} — you can further customize these later. To learn more, refer to {fleet-guide}/agent-policy.html[{agent} policies].
For Traditional Endpoints, there are three presets:
  * *Next Generation Antivirus:*
    - Events collected: Process
    - Active preventions: Malware, Ransomware, Memory Protection
  * *Essential Endpoint Detection & Response:*
    - Events collected: Process, Network, File
    - Active preventions: Malware, Ransomware, Memory Protection
  * *Complete Endpoint Detection & Response:*
    - Events collected: Process, Network, File, Session Data
    - Active preventions: Malware, Ransomware, Memory Protection

For Cloud Workloads, there are two presets:
  * *All events:*
    - Events collected: Process, Network, File, Session Data
    - Preventions: none
  * *Interactive only:*
    - Events collected: Process, Network, File, Session Data
    - Preventions: none
    - Event filter: filters out non-interactive sessions
. Enter a name for the agent policy in **New agent policy name**. If other agent policies already exist, you can click the **Existing hosts** tab and select an existing policy instead. For more details on {agent} configuration settings, refer to {fleet-guide}/agent-policy.html[{agent} policies].
. When you're ready, click **Save and continue**.
. To complete the integration, continue to the next section to install the {agent} on your hosts.

[[enroll-security-agent]]
== Configure and enroll the {agent}

To enable the {elastic-defend} integration, you must enroll agents in the relevant policy using {fleet}.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
Before you add an {agent}, a {fleet-server} must be running. Refer to {fleet-guide}/add-a-fleet-server.html[Add a {fleet-server}].

{elastic-defend} cannot be integrated with an {agent} in standalone mode.

[[fleet-server-upgrade]]
=== Important information about {fleet-server}

NOTE: If you are running an {stack} version earlier than 7.13.0, you can skip this section.

If you have upgraded to an {stack} version that includes {fleet-server} 7.13.0 or newer, you will need to redeploy your agents. Review the following scenarios to ensure you take the appropriate steps.

* If you redeploy the {agent} to the same machine through the {fleet} application after you upgrade, a new agent will appear.
* If you want to remove the {agent} entirely without transitioning to the {fleet-server}, then you will need to manually uninstall the {agent} on the machine. This will also uninstall the endpoint. Refer to {fleet-guide}/uninstall-elastic-agent.html[Uninstall Elastic Agent].
* In the rare event that the {agent} fails to uninstall, you might need to manually uninstall the endpoint. Refer to <<uninstall-endpoint, Uninstall an endpoint>> at the end of this topic.

[[enroll-agent]]
=== Add the {agent}

. Go to *{fleet}* -> *Agents* -> **Add agent**.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/install-endpoint/endpoint-cloud-sec-add-agent.png[Add agent flyout on the Fleet page.]

. Select an agent policy for the {agent}. You can select an existing policy, or select **Create new agent policy** to create a new one. For more details on {agent} configuration settings, refer to {fleet-guide}/agent-policy.html[{agent} policies].
+
The selected agent policy should include {elastic-defend}.

. Ensure that the **Enroll in {fleet}** option is selected. {elastic-defend} cannot be integrated with {agent} in standalone mode.

. Select the appropriate platform or operating system for the host, then copy the provided commands.

. On the host, open a command-line interface and navigate to the directory where you want to install {agent}. Paste and run the commands from {fleet} to download, extract, enroll, and start {agent}.

. (Optional) Return to the **Add agent** flyout in {fleet}, and observe the **Confirm agent enrollment** and **Confirm incoming data** steps automatically checking the host connection. It may take a few minutes for data to arrive in {es}.

. After you have enrolled the {agent} on your host, you can click **View enrolled agents** to access the list of agents enrolled in {fleet}. Otherwise, select **Close**.
+
The host will now appear on the **Endpoints** page in the {security-app}. It may take another minute or two for endpoint data to appear in {elastic-sec}.

. For macOS, continue with <<deploy-elastic-endpoint, these instructions>> to grant {elastic-endpoint} the access it needs.
