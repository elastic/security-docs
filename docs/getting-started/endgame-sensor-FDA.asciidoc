= Enable Full Disk Access for the Endgame sensor

If your solution includes Elastic Endgame, it requires Full Disk Access to protect you from malware and other cybersecurity threats. Full Disk Access permissions is a new privacy feature introduced in macOS Mojave (10.14) that controls which applications can access your data. This means you need to manually enable Full Disk Access permission for the Endgame sensor to access these protected areas of your Mac.

[[macos-permissions]]
== macOS permissions

The behavior of the Endgame sensor differs based on your macOS version. MDM/Jamf users can pre-approve all Full Disk Access without granting permission to the sensor. However, depending on the macOS version and sensor type, non-MDM/Jamf users may be prompted to enable Full Disk Access for required security files.

Here are the following Full Disk Access requirements for specific versions of macOS:

- `10.13, 10.14, 10.15`: You cannot install the sensor without allowing it to load a <<kernel-ext-approval-endgame, kernel extension>>. During installation, you'll be prompted to go to System Preferences and approve it. Upon approval, installation proceeds.

- `11.0`, `12.0`: You cannot install the sensor without allowing it to load a <<system-extension, system extension>>. During installation, you'll be prompted to go to System Preferences and approve it. Upon approval, a second prompt appears to enable Network Filtering. Approve this final prompt to proceed.
+
You must also grant Full Disk Access to `com.endgame.systemextension`.

- `10.14.6+, 10.15, 11.0, 12.0`: Grant the <<endpoint-endgame-sensor, esensor file>> Full Disk Access.

NOTE: The following instructions apply to the Endgame sensor only. To see requirements for the {elastic-endpoint}, refer to <<deploy-elastic-endpoint>>.

[[kernel-ext-approval-endgame]]
== Approve the kernel extension for the Endgame sensor

For endpoints running macOS Mojave (10.14) and earlier, the Endgame sensor will attempt to load a kernel extension (as opposed to a system extension) during installation. This kernel extension is required to provide insight into system events such as process events, file system events, and network events. The following prompt appears during installation:

--

--

To approve the extension:

. Click *Open Security Preferences*.
. In the lower-left corner of the pane, click the **Lock button**, then enter your credentials to authenticate.
. Click *Allow* to load the kernel extension.
+
--

If the prompt does not appear, enable the extension by doing the following:

. Open a Terminal application.
. Enter `kextload /Library/Extension/kendpoint.kext`. Prepend the command with `sudo` if necessary.
You should receive an output similar to `149    0 0xffffff7f82e7b000 0x21000    0x21000    co.elastic.kendpoint (7.11.0) BD152A57-ABD3-370A-BBE8-D15A0FCBD19A <6 5 2 1>`. If you receive this output, the kernel extension is enabled.

[[system-extension]]
== Approve the system extension for the Endgame sensor

To fully protect endpoints from malware and other cybersecurity threats when using Elastic Endgame with system extensions, you must enable Full Disk Access for the system extension during installation on macOS Big Sur (11.0) and later.

When you receive the prompt to approve loading the system extension:

. Open the *System Preferences* application.
. Select *Security and Privacy*.
+
--

. On the Security and Privacy pane, select the *Privacy* tab.

. From the left pane, select *Full Disk Access*.

--
image::images/fda/select-fda.png[Select Full Disk Access]
--
+
. In the lower-left corner of the pane, click the *Lock button*, then enter your credentials to authenticate.
. Click the *+* button to view *Finder*. Find  `com.endgame.systemextension` and select it.
. Continue below to enable Full Disk Access for the Endgame sensor.

[[endpoint-endgame-sensor]]
== Enable Full Disk Access for the Endgame sensor

For the Endgame sensor to detect events from a macOS host, you must enable Full Disk Access for the `esensor` file, which appears once you've downloaded the sensor on your host.

. Open the *System Preferences* application.
. Click *Security and Privacy*.
. On the *Security and Privacy* pane, select the *Privacy* tab.
. From the left pane, select *Full Disk Access*.
+
--
image::images/select-fda.png[Select Full Disk Access]
--
+
. In the lower-left corner of the pane, click the *Lock button*, then enter your credentials to authenticate. You can now add the `elastic-endpoint` or `esensor` file.
. Click the *+* button to view *Finder*.
. Navigate to `/Library/Endgame`, then select the `esensor` file.
. Click *Open*.
. In the *Privacy* tab, confirm that the `elastic-agent` or `esensor` file appears in the list of applications with Full Disk Access permissions.

The Endgame sensor now has the access required to fully protect your system.
