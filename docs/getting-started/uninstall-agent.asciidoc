[[uninstall-agent]]
= Uninstall {agent}

To uninstall {agent} from a host, run the `uninstall` command from the directory where it's running. Refer to the {fleet-guide}/uninstall-elastic-agent.html[{fleet} and {agent} documentation] for more information.

If <<agent-tamper-protection,Agent tamper protection>> is enabled on the Agent policy for the host, you'll need to include the uninstall token in the command, using the `--uninstall-token` flag. You can <<fleet-uninstall-tokens,find the uninstall token>> on the Agent policy or at *{fleet}* -> *Uninstall tokens*.

For example, to uninstall {agent} on a macOS or Linux host:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------
sudo elastic-agent uninstall --uninstall-token 12345678901234567890123456789012
----------------------------------
