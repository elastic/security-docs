[[endpoint-diagnostic-data]]
= Turn off diagnostic data for {endpoint-cloud-sec}

By default, {endpoint-cloud-sec} streams diagnostic data to your cluster, which Elastic uses to tune protection features. You can stop producing this diagnostic data by configuring the advanced settings in the {endpoint-cloud-sec} integration policy.

NOTE: {kib} also collects usage telemetry, which includes {endpoint-cloud-sec} diagnostic data. You can modify telemetry preferences in {kibana-ref}/telemetry-settings-kbn.html[Advanced Settings].

. In the {security-app}, go to *Manage* -> *Endpoints* to view the Endpoints list.
. Locate the endpoint for which you want to disable diagnostic data, then click the integration policy in the *Policy* column.
. Scroll down to the bottom of the policy and click *Show advanced settings*.
. Enter `false` for these settings:
  * `windows.advanced.diagnostic.enabled`
  * `linux.advanced.diagnostic.enabled`
  * `mac.advanced.diagnostic.enabled`
. Click *Save*.
