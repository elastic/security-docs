[[endpoint-diagnostic-data]]
= Turn off {endpoint-sec} diagnostic data

By default, {endpoint-sec} streams diagnostic data to your cluster, which Elastic uses to tune protection features. You can stop producing this diagnostic data by configuring the advanced settings in the {endpoint-sec} integration policy.

NOTE: Kibana also collects usage telemetry, which you can control in {kibana-ref}/telemetry-settings-kbn.html[Kibana's Advanced Settings].

. In the {security-app}, go to *Manage* -> *Endpoints* to view the Endpoints list.
. In the *Policy* column, select the integration policy you want to configure.
. Scroll down to the bottom of the policy and click *Show advanced settings*.
. Enter `false` for these settings:
  * `windows.advanced.diagnostic.enabled`
  * `linux.advanced.diagnostic.enabled`
  * `mac.advanced.diagnostic.enabled`
. Click *Save*.
