If your solution includes Elastic Endgame, it requires Full Disk Access to protect you from malware and other cybersecurity threats. Full Disk Access permissions is a privacy feature that controls which applications can access your data. This means you need to manually enable Full Disk Access permission for the Elastic Endgame sensor to access these protected areas of your Mac.

[[macos-permissions-ven]]
== macOS permissions

The behavior of the Elastic Endgame sensor differs based on your macOS version. MDM/Jamf users can pre-approve all Full Disk Access without granting permission to the sensor. However, depending on the macOS version and sensor type, non-MDM/Jamf users may be prompted to enable Full Disk Access for required security files.

Here are the following Full Disk Access requirements for specific versions of macOS:


- `13.0` and above: You cannot install the sensor without allowing it to load a <<system-extension, system extension>>. During installation, you'll be prompted to go to System Preferences and approve it. Upon approval, a second prompt appears to enable Network Filtering. Approve this final prompt to proceed.
+
You must also grant Full Disk Access to `com.endgame.systemextension`.

- `13` and above: Grant the <<endpoint-endgame-sensor, esensor file>> Full Disk Access.

NOTE: The following instructions apply to the Elastic Endgame sensor only. To see requirements for the {elastic-endpoint}, refer to <<deploy-elastic-endpoint>>.

[[system-extension-ven]]
== Approve the system extension for the Elastic Endgame sensor

To fully protect endpoints from malware and other cybersecurity threats when using Elastic Endgame with system extensions, you must enable the system extension during installation on macOS Big Sur (11.0) and later.

When you receive the prompt to approve loading the system extension:

. Open the *System Settings* application.
. Select *Privacy & Security*.
. In the right pane, scroll down to the Security section. Click **Allow** to allow the Elastic Endgame system extension to load.

[[allow-network-filter-content-ven]]
== Approve network content filtering for Elastic Endgame

After successfully loading the Elastic Endgame system extension, an additional message appears, asking to allow Elastic Endgame to filter network content.

Click *Allow* to enable content filtering for the Elastic Endgame system extension. Without this approval, Elastic Endgame cannot receive network events and, therefore, cannot enable network-related features such as <<host-isolation-ov, host isolation>>.

[[endpoint-endgame-sensor-ven]]
== Enable Full Disk Access for the Elastic Endgame sensor

For the Elastic Endgame sensor to detect events from a macOS host, you must enable Full Disk Access for the `esensor` file, which appears once you've downloaded the sensor on your host.

. Open the *System Settings* application.
. Select *Privacy & Security*.
. From the right pane, select *Full Disk Access*.

. Navigate to `/Library/Endgame`, then select the `esensor` file.
. Click *Open*.
. In the *Privacy* tab, confirm that the `elastic-agent` or `esensor` file appears in the list of applications with Full Disk Access permissions.

The Elastic Endgame sensor now has the access required to fully protect your system.
