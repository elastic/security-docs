On macOS versions starting with Ventura, Elastic Endgame requires Full Disk Access to protect against malware and other cybersecurity threats. Full Disk Access permission is a privacy feature that controls which applications can access your data. This means you need to manually enable Full Disk Access permission for the Elastic Endgame sensor to access these protected areas of your Mac.

== macOS permissions

The behavior of the Elastic Endgame sensor differs based on your macOS version. MDM/Jamf users can pre-approve all Full Disk Access without granting permission to the sensor. However, depending on the macOS version and sensor type, non-MDM/Jamf users may be prompted to enable Full Disk Access for required security files.

Here are the Full Disk Access requirements for macOS versions 13.0 and above:

- Approve the <<system-extension-ven, system extension>> for the Elastic Endgame sensor. During installation, youâ€™ll be prompted to go to System Preferences and approve the system extension. Upon approval, a second prompt appears to enable Network Filtering. Approve this final prompt to proceed.
- Grant the <<endpoint-endgame-sensor-ven, Elastic Endgame sensor>>  Full Disk Access.

NOTE: The following instructions apply to the Elastic Endgame sensor only. To see requirements for the {elastic-endpoint}, refer to <<deploy-elastic-endpoint-ven>>.

== Approve the system extension for the Elastic Endgame sensor

To fully protect endpoints from malware and other cybersecurity threats when using Elastic Endgame with system extensions, you must enable the system extension during installation on macOS Ventura (13.0) and later.

When you receive the following prompt to approve loading the system extension:

[[allow-network-filter-content-ven]]
== Approve network content filtering for Elastic Endgame

After successfully loading the Elastic Endgame system extension, an additional message appears, asking to allow Elastic Endgame to filter network content.

Click *Allow* to enable content filtering for the Elastic Endgame system extension. Without this approval, Elastic Endgame cannot receive network events and, therefore, cannot enable network-related features such as <<host-isolation-ov, host isolation>>.

[[endpoint-endgame-sensor-ven]]
== Enable Full Disk Access for the Elastic Endgame sensor

For the Elastic Endgame sensor to detect events from a macOS host, you must enable Full Disk Access for the `esensor` file, which appears once you've downloaded the sensor on your host.

. Open the *System Settings* application.
. Select *Privacy & Security*.
. From the right pane, select *Full Disk Access*.
