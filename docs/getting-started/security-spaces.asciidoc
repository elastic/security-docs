= Spaces and {elastic-sec}

{elastic-sec} supports the organization of your security operations into
logical instances with the {kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html[spaces]
feature. Each space in {kib} represents a separate logical instance of
{elastic-sec} in which detection rules, rule exceptions, value lists,
alerts, Timelines, cases, and {kib} advanced settings are private to the
space and accessible only by users that have role privileges to
access the space. For details about privileges for
{elastic-sec} and specific features, refer to <<sec-requirements>>.

For example, if you create a `SOC_prod` space in which you load and
activate all the {elastic-sec} prebuilt detection rules, these rules and
any detection alerts they generate will be accessible only when visiting
the {security-app} in the `SOC_prod` space. If you then create a new
`SOC_dev` space, you'll notice that no detection rules or alerts are
present. Any rules subsequently loaded or created here will be private to
the `SOC_dev` space, and they will run independently of those in the
`SOC_prod` space.

[NOTE]
===== 
By default, alerts created by detection rules are stored in {es} indices
under the `.alerts-security.alerts-<space-name>` index pattern, and they may be
accessed by any user with role privileges to access those
{es} indices. In our example above, any user with {es} privileges to access
`.alerts-security.alerts-SOC_prod` will be able to view `SOC_prod` alerts from
within {es} and other {kib} apps such as Discover and Lens. 

To ensure that detection alert data remains private to the space in which
it was created, ensure that the roles assigned to your {elastic-sec} users
include {es} privileges that limit their access to alerts
within their space's alerts index.
