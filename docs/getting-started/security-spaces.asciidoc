= Spaces and {elastic-sec}

{elastic-sec} supports the organization of your security operations into
logical instances with the {kibana-ref}/xpack-spaces.html[{kib} Spaces]
feature. Each {kib} space represents a separate logical instance of
{elastic-sec} in which detection rules, rule exceptions, value lists,
alerts, timelines, cases, and {kib} advanced settings are private to the
space, accessible only by users assigned to roles that have privileges to
access the space. For details about configuring privileges for
{es} and {kib}, see <<detections-permissions-section>> .

For example, if you create a `SOC_prod` space in which you load and
activate all the {elastic-sec} prebuilt detection rules, these rules and
any detection alerts they generate will be accessible only when visiting
the {security-app} in the `SOC_prod` space. If you then create a new
`SOC_dev` space, you'll notice that no detection rules or alerts are
present. Any rules subsequently loaded or created here will be private to
the `SOC_dev` space, and they will run independently of those in the
`SOC_prod` space.

[NOTE]
===== 
By default, alerts created by detection rules are stored in {es} indices
under the `.siem-signals-<spacename>-*` index pattern, and they may be
accessed by any user assigned to a role with privileges to access those
{es} indices. In our example above, any user with {es} privileges to access
`.siem-signals-SOC_prod-*` will be able to view `SOC_prod` alerts from
within {es} and other {kib} apps such as Discover and Lens. 

To ensure that alert data remains private to the space in which it was
created, ensure that the roles to which your security solution users are
assigned include {es} privileges that limit their access to only alerts
within their space alerts index.
