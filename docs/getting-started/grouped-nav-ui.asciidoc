[[grouped-nav-ui]]
= Grouped navigation menu

{elastic-sec}'s grouped navigation menu groups related pages and highlights commonly visited areas for a streamlined experience. 

NOTE: By default, the {security-app} uses the legacy navigation menu. To enable grouped navigation, go to *{kib}* -> *{stack-manage-app}* -> *Advanced Settings*, then turn on `securitySolution:enableGroupedNav`.

The side navigation menu contains direct links and expandable groups, identified by the group icon (image:images/group-icon.png[Group icon,16,16]).

* Click top-level links to go directly to pages that are essential for detection and investigation workflows (*Alerts*, *Timelines*, and *Cases*).

* Click a group's name to go to its landing page, with links and information for related pages.

* Click a group's icon (image:images/group-icon.png[Group icon,16,15]) to open its flyout menu. This displays the same links and information as the landing page, but without navigating away from the current page.

* Use the *Manage* group to configure {elastic-sec} for various use cases, such as SIEM and endpoint management.
