= {elastic-defend} feature privileges

You can create user roles and define privileges to manage feature access in {kib}. This allows you to use the principle of least privilege while managing access to {elastic-defend}'s features.

Roles and privileges are configured in *Stack Management* -> *Roles* in {kib}. For more details on using this UI, refer to {kibana-ref}/kibana-role-management.html#adding_kibana_privileges[{kib} privileges]. 

NOTE: {elastic-defend}'s feature privileges must be assigned to *All Spaces*. You can't assign them to an individual {kib} space.

To grant access, select *All* for the *Security* feature in the *{kib} privileges* configuration UI, then turn on the *Customize sub-feature privileges* switch. For each of the following sub-feature privileges, select the type of access you want to allow:

* `All`: Users have full access to the feature and can perform all available actions and configuration.
* `Read`: Users can view the feature, but they can't perform any actions or configuration. (Some features don't have this privilege.)
* `None`: Users can't access or view the feature.
