= {elastic-defend} feature privileges

You can create user roles and define privileges to manage feature access in {kib}. This allows you to use the principle of least privilege while managing access to {elastic-defend}'s features.

Roles and privileges are configured in *Stack Management* -> *Roles* in {kib}. For more details on using this UI, refer to {kibana-ref}/kibana-role-management.html#adding_kibana_privileges[{kib} privileges]. 

NOTE: {elastic-defend}'s feature privileges must be assigned to *All Spaces*. You can't assign them to an individual {kib} space. 

To grant access, set the privileges for the following sub-features under the *Security* feature in the *{kib} privileges* configuration UI:
