= Elastic Security UI

The {security-app} is a highly interactive workspace designed for security analysts. It provides a clear overview of events and alerts from your environment, and you can use the interactive UI to drill down into areas of interest.

[[search-overview]]
== Search

Filter for alerts, events, processes, and other important security data with the benefit of *{kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language (KQL)]* in the  Search bar, which appears at the top of each page throughout the app. A date/time filter set to `Last 24 hours` is enabled by default, but can be changed to any time range. If you want to filter your search results with other fields, select **Add Filter,** followed by the field from which to filter and the operator (such `is not` or `is between`) for your query.

To save specific filters and queries, click the *Save* button, then **Save current query.**

[[page-tabs]]
== Page tabs

The {security-app} contains the following pages that enable analysts to view, analyze, and manage security data:

* Overview
* Alerts
* Rules
* Exceptions
* Hosts
* Network
* Timelines
* Cases
* Endpoints
* Trusted applications
* Event filters

Pages are grouped into four main sections within the navigation pane -- Detect, Explore, Investigate, and Manage. Each section supports a different part of your workflow and describes actions you can perform in the {security-app}.

From the *Detect* section, you can access pages that allow you to view, create, and manage alerts, rules, and rule exceptions.

Under *Explore*, you access pages that provide key metrics about your hosts and networks.

The *Investigate* section gives you access to timelines and cases.

Pages under the *Manage* section allow to view and manage hosts that are running Endpoint Security. You can also view and manage trusted applications and event filters from pages in this section.

TIP: Click the *Collapse side navigation*  button to collapse and expand the main navigation menu.

[[overview-ui]]
=== Overview page

The Overview page provides a high-level snapshot view of detections, external alerts, and event trends. These trends are useful to assess overall system health and find anomalies that may require further investigation.

image::images/overview-pg.png[Shows the Overview page]

From the live feed on the *Overview* page, you can quickly access recently created cases, favorited timelines, and the latest {elastic-sec} news.

TIP: The *Security news* section provides you with the latest {elastic-sec} news so you can stay informed on new developments, learn about {elastic-sec} features, and more.

image::images/live-feed-ov-page.png[Shows the Overview page]

*Histograms*

Time-based histograms show you the number of detections, alerts, and events that have occurred within the selected time range. You can select areas of interest in time-based histograms by selecting a region to reflect a date range, or by selecting a preset value in the timepicker. In the **Stack by** dropdown, you can select specific parameters for which to visualize the individual counts. For example, in the Detection alert trend histogram, stack by `signal.rule.name` to display the total counts by alert name within the specified time frame.

TIP: All Elastic Security histograms, graphs, and tables contain an **Inspect** button so you can examine the {es} queries used to retrieve data throughout
the app.

*Host and network events*

View event and host counts specific to Elastic data shippers and apps, such as **Auditbeats** or **Elastic Endpoint Security**. Expand each category to view specific counts of hosts or network events related to the selected category.

*Threat Intelligence*

The Threat Intelligence view shows the total number of threat indicator events collected by the Threat Intel Filebeat module. This module ingests, parses, and visualizes data from several open source threat feeds to provide you with relevant and timely threat intelligence. As a security analyst, you can use this data in a variety of ways. For example, you can reference this data while building new threat indicator match rules or triaging alerts. Or, you use it to assess the robustness of your organization's security controls and make suggestions for improvements. Regardless of your goal, the Threat Intel Filebeat module offers you timely and actionable threat intelligence that you can leverage for your, or your organization's, detection and prevention needs.

To open a full view of the Threat Intel Filebeat module, click **View dashboard**. To further inspect data from the ingested threat intelligence sources, click **View source dashboard** for the appropriate source.

There are a few scenarios when data won't display in the Threat Intelligence view:

- If you've chosen a time range that doesn't contain threat indicator event data, you'll be prompted to choose a different range. Use the the date and time picker in the {security-app} or Kibana to select a new range to analyze.
- If the Filebeat agent hasn't ingested Threat Intel Filebeat module data yet, the **View dashboard** button greys out and threat indicator event counts won't load. You can wait for data to generate or reach out to your administrator for help resolving this.
