= Elastic Security UI

The {security-app} is a highly interactive workspace designed for security analysts that provides a clear overview of events and alerts from your environment. You can use the interactive UI to drill down into areas of interest.

[[search-overview]]
== Search

Filter for alerts, events, processes, and other important security data by entering *{kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language (KQL)]* queries in the search bar, which appears at the top of each page throughout the app. A date/time filter set to `Today` is enabled by default, but can be changed to any time range.

* To refine your search results, select *Add Filter* (image:images/add-filter-icon.png[Add filter icon,17,17]), then enter the field, operator (such as `is not` or `is between`), and value for your filter.

* To save the current KQL query and any applied filters, select *Saved query menu* (image:images/saved-query-menu-icon.png[Saved query menu icon,18,18]), enter a name for the saved query, and select *Save saved query*.

== Navigation menu

The navigation menu contains direct links and expandable groups, identified by the group icon (image:images/group-icon.png[Group icon,16,16]).

* Click a top-level link to go directly to its landing page, which contains links and information for related pages.

* Click a group's icon (image:images/group-icon.png[Group icon,16,15]) to open its flyout menu, which displays links to related pages within that group. Click a link in the flyout to navigate to its landing page.

[[timeline-accessibility-features]]
== Accessibility features

Accessibility features, such as keyboard focus and screen reader support, are built into the Elastic Security UI. These features offer additional ways to navigate the UI and interact with the application.

[[draggable-timeline-elements]]
=== Interact with draggable elements

Use your keyboard to interact with draggable elements in the Elastic Security UI:

* Press the `Tab` key to apply keyboard focus to an element within a table. Or, use your mouse to click on an element and apply keyboard focus to it.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/timeline-accessiblity-keyboard-focus.gif[width=100%][height=100%][Demo that shows how to give a draggable element keyboard focus]

* Press `Enter` on an element with keyboard focus to display its menu and press `Tab` to apply focus sequentially to menu options. The `f`, `o`, `a`, `t`, `c` hotkeys are automatically enabled during this process and offer an alternative way to interact with menu options.

[role="screenshot"]

* If an event has an event renderer, press the `Shift` key and the down directional arrow to apply keyboard focus to the event renderer and `Tab` or `Shift` + `Tab` to navigate between fields. To return to the cells in the current row, press the up directional arrow. To move to the next row, press the down directional arrow.
