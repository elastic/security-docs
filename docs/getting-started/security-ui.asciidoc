= Elastic Security UI

The {security-app} is a highly interactive workspace designed for security analysts. It provides a clear overview of events and alerts from your environment, and you can use the interactive UI to drill down into areas of interest.

[[search-overview]]
== Search

Filter for alerts, events, processes, and other important security data with the benefit of *{kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language (KQL)]* in the  Search bar, which appears at the top of each page throughout the app. A date/time filter set to `Last 24 hours` is enabled by default, but can be changed to any time range. If you want to filter your search results with other fields, select **Add Filter,** followed by the field from which to filter and the operator (such `is not` or `is between`) for your query.

To save specific filters and queries, click the *Save* button, then **Save current query.**

[[page-tabs]]
== Page tabs

The {security-app} contains seven page tabs that enable analysts to view, analyze, and manage security data:

* Overview
* Detections
* Hosts
* Network
* Timelines
* Cases
* Administration

[[overview-ui]]
=== Overview page

The Overview page provides a high-level snapshot view of detections, external alerts, and event trends. These trends are useful to assess overall system health and find anomalies that may require further investigation.

*Histograms*

Time-based histograms show you the number of detections, alerts, and events that have occurred within the selected time range. You can select areas of interest in time-based histograms by selecting a region to reflect a date range, or by selecting a preset value in the timepicker. In the **Stack by** dropdown, you can select specific parameters for which to visualize the individual counts. For example, in the Detection alert trend histogram, stack by `signal.rule.name` to display the total counts by alert name within the specified time frame.

TIP: All Elastic Security histograms, graphs, and tables contain an **Inspect** button so you can examine the {es} queries used to retrieve data throughout
the app.

*Host and network events*

View event and host counts specific to Elastic data shippers and apps, such as **Auditbeats** or **Elastic Endpoint Security**. Expand each category to view specific counts of hosts or network events related to the selected category.

*Threat Intelligence card*

The Threat Intelligence card shows you the total number of indicator match events that the Threat Intel Filebeat module has collected, plus the individual event counts of open source threat feeds the module ingests. To open the Threat Intel Filebeat module in Kibana, click **View dashboard**. Clicking **View source dashboard** allows you to view threat intelligence data that the module has collected from other open source feeds. For example, clicking **View source dashboard** for the Abuse Malware feed opens the Filebeat Threat Intel Abuse Malware dashboard in Kibana, which displays data such as file hashes and hosts with additional context for significant dates, tags, and status.

[[detection-engine-ui]]
=== Detections page

The Detections page allows you to view and manage all alerts and detection rules to monitor activity within your network. See <<detection-engine-overview, Detections and Alerts (beta)>> for more information about detections, prebuilt rules, and alerts.

[[timelines-page]]
=== Timelines page

Use the Timelines page to investigate alerts and complex threats, such as lateral movement of malware across hosts in your network. Timelines are responsive and allow you to share your findings among other team members. See <<timelines-ui, Investigate events in Timeline>> for information about getting started with Timelines.

TIP: Select the collapsable *Timeline* button on the rightmost side of the {security-app} to start an investigation.

[[admin-ui]]
=== Administration page

The Administration page allows you to view and manage hosts that are running Endpoint Security. You can also manage agent integration, trusted applications, and monitor the configuration status of your hosts to ensure they are protected. See <<admin-page-ov, Administration page overview>> for more information.
