= Elastic Security UI

The {security-app} is a highly interactive workspace designed for security analysts that provides a clear overview of events and alerts from your environment. You can use the interactive UI to drill down into areas of interest.

[[search-overview]]
== Search

Filter for alerts, events, processes, and other important security data by entering *{kibana-ref}/kuery-query.html[{kib} Query Language (KQL)]* queries in the search bar, which appears at the top of each page throughout the app. A date/time filter set to `Today` is enabled by default, but can be changed to any time range.

* To refine your search results, select *Add Filter* (image:images/add-filter-icon.png[Add filter icon,17,17]), then enter the field, operator (such as `is not` or `is between`), and value for your filter.

* To save the current KQL query and any applied filters, select *Saved query menu* (image:images/saved-query-menu-icon.png[Saved query menu icon,18,18]), enter a name for the saved query, and select *Save saved query*.

== Page navigation

The {security-app} contains the following pages that enable analysts to view, analyze, and manage security data:

* Get started
* Overview
* Alerts
* Rules
* Exception lists
* Hosts
* Network
* Users
* Timelines
* Cases
* Endpoints
* Policies
* Trusted applications
* Event filters
* Host isolation exceptions
* Blocklist

Pages are grouped into four main sections within the navigation pane:

* *Detect*: View, create, and manage alerts, rules, and rule exceptions.

* *Explore*: Access key metrics about your hosts, network, and users.

* *Investigate*: Access and manage Timelines and cases.

* *Manage*: View and manage hosts that are running {endpoint-sec}.

TIP: Click the *Collapse side navigation*  button to collapse and expand the main navigation menu.

[[getting-started-page]]
=== Get started page

The Get started page guides you to integrations that you can use to monitor your hosts and ingest data. Other {security-app} pages that show event data (for example, the Hosts and Network pages) display the get started prompt until event data has been ingested.

[[overview-ui]]
=== Overview page

The Overview page provides a high-level snapshot view of detections, external alerts, and event trends. These trends are useful to assess overall system health and find anomalies that may require further investigation.

image::images/overview-pg.png[Shows the Overview page]

From the live feed on the *Overview* page, you can quickly access recently created cases, favorited timelines, and the latest {elastic-sec} news.

TIP: The *Security news* section provides you with the latest {elastic-sec} news to stay informed on new developments, learn about {elastic-sec} features, and more.

image::images/live-feed-ov-page.png[Shows the Overview page]

*Histograms*

Time-based histograms show you the number of detections, alerts, and events that have occurred within the selected time range. To focus on areas of interest in time-based histograms, select a region to reflect a date range, or select a preset value in the timepicker. In the **Stack by** dropdown, you can select specific parameters to visualize individual counts. For example, in the Detection alert trend histogram, stack by `kibana.alert.rule.name` to display the total counts by alert name within the specified time frame.

TIP: All Elastic Security histograms, graphs, and tables contain an **Inspect** button so you can examine the {es} queries used to retrieve data throughout
the app.

*Host and network events*

View event and host counts specific to Elastic data shippers and apps, such as **Auditbeats** or **Elastic Endpoint Security**. Expand each category to view specific counts of hosts or network events related to the selected category.

*Threat Intelligence*

The Threat Intelligence view on the Overview page provides a streamlined way to collect threat intelligence data for threat detection and matching.

The view shows the total number of ingested threat indicators, enabled threat intelligence sources, and ingested threat indicators per source. To visualize the ingested threat indicator data, click the *Source* link for a threat intelligence source.

NOTE: For more information about connecting to threat intelligence sources, visit <<es-threat-intel-integrations, Enable threat intelligence integrations>>.
