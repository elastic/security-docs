If you encounter a `“Required transform failed”` notice on the Endpoints page, you can usually resolve the issue by restarting the transform. See {ref}/transforms.html[Transforming data] for more information on transforms.

To restart a transform that’s not running:

. Go to *Stack Management -> Data -> Transforms*.
. Search for `endpoint.metadata_current-default` in the search box to find the transform for {endpoint-sec}.
. Click the *Actions* icon (*...*) and do one of the following, depending on the value in the *Status* column:
* `stopped`: Select *Start* to restart the transform. 
* `failed`: Select *Stop* to first stop the transform, and then select *Start* to restart it.
. A confirmation message is displayed. Click *Start* to confirm.
. The transform’s status will change to `started`. You might need to refresh the page to see the change.
