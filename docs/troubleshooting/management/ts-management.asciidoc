.Unhealthy {agent} status
[%collapsible]
====
In some cases, an `Unhealthy` {agent} status may be caused by a failure in the {elastic-defend} integration policy. In this situation, the integration and any failing features are flagged on the agent details page in {fleet}. Expand each section and subsection to display individual responses from the agent.

TIP: Integration policy response information is also available from the *Endpoints* page in the {security-app} (*Manage* -> *Endpoints*, then click the link in the *Policy status* column).

Common causes of failure in the {elastic-defend} integration policy include missing prerequisites or unexpected system configuration. Consult the following topics to resolve a specific error:

- <<system-extension-endpoint,Approve the system extension for {elastic-endpoint}>> (macOS)
- <<enable-fda-endpoint,Enable Full Disk Access for {elastic-endpoint}>> (macOS)
- <<linux-deadlock,Resolve a potential system deadlock>> (Linux)

TIP: If the {elastic-defend} integration policy is not the cause of the `Unhealthy` agent status, refer to {fleet-guide}/fleet-troubleshooting.html[{fleet} troubleshooting] for help with the {agent}.

[[linux-deadlock]]
.Disabled to avoid potential system deadlock (Linux)
[%collapsible]
====
If you have an `Unhealthy` {agent} status with the message `Disabled due to potential system deadlock`, that means malware protection was disabled on the {elastic-defend} integration policy due to errors while monitoring a Linux host.

You can resolve the issue by configuring the policy's <<linux-file-monitoring,advanced settings>> related to *fanotify*, a Linux feature that monitors file system events. By default, {elastic-defend} works with fanotify to monitor specific file system types that Elastic has tested for compatibility, and ignores other unknown file system types.

If your network includes nonstandard, proprietary, or otherwise unrecognized Linux file systems that cause errors while being monitored, you can configure {elastic-defend} to ignore those file systems. This allows {elastic-defend} to resume monitoring and protecting the hosts on the integration policy.

CAUTION: Ignoring file systems can create gaps in your security coverage. Use additional security layers for any file systems ignored by {elastic-defend}.

To resolve the potential system deadlock error:

. Go to *Manage* -> *Policies*, then click a policy's name.

. Scroll to the bottom of the policy and click *Show advanced settings*.

. In the setting `linux.advanced.fanotify.ignored_filesystems`, enter a comma-separated list of file system names to ignore, as they appear in `/proc/filesystems` (for example: `ext4,tmpfs`). Refer to <<find-file-system-names>> for more on determining the file system names.

. Click *Save*. 
+
Once you save the policy, malware protection is re-enabled.

.Required transform failed

====
If you encounter a `“Required transform failed”` notice on the Endpoints page, you can usually resolve the issue by restarting the transform. Refer to {ref}/transforms.html[Transforming data] for more information about transforms.

To restart a transform that’s not running:

. Go to *Kibana* -> *Stack Management* -> *Data* -> *Transforms*.
. Enter `endpoint.metadata` in the search box to find the transforms for {elastic-defend}.
. Click the *Actions* menu (*...*) and do one of the following for each transform, depending on the value in the *Status* column:
* `stopped`: Select *Start* to restart the transform. 
* `failed`: Select *Stop* to first stop the transform, and then select *Start* to restart it.

. On the confirmation message that displays, click *Start* to restart the transform.
. The transform’s status changes to `started`. Refresh the page if you don't observe the change.
