.Unhealthy {agent} status
[%collapsible]
====
In some cases, an `Unhealthy` {agent} status may be caused by a failure in the {endpoint-cloud-sec} integration policy. In this situation, the integration and any failing features are flagged on the agent details page in {fleet}. Expand each section and subsection to display individual responses from the agent.

TIP: Integration policy response information is also available from the *Endpoints* page in the {security-app} (*Manage* -> *Endpoints*, then click the link in the *Policy status* column).

Common causes of failure in the {endpoint-cloud-sec} integration policy include missing prerequisites or unexpected system configuration. Consult the following topics to resolve a specific error:

- <<system-extension-endpoint,Approve the system extension for {elastic-endpoint}>> (macOS)
- <<enable-fda-endpoint,Enable Full Disk Access for {elastic-endpoint}>> (macOS)
- <<linux-deadlock,Resolve a potential system deadlock>> (Linux)

TIP: If the {endpoint-cloud-sec} integration policy is not the cause of the `Unhealthy` agent status, refer to {fleet-guide}/fleet-troubleshooting.html[{fleet} troubleshooting] for help with the {agent}.

If you encounter a `“Required transform failed”` notice on the Endpoints page, you can usually resolve the issue by restarting the transform. See {ref}/transforms.html[Transforming data] for more information about transforms.

To restart a transform that’s not running:

. Go to *Kibana* -> *Stack Management* -> *Data* -> *Transforms*.
. Enter `endpoint.metadata` in the search box to find the transforms for {endpoint-cloud-sec}.
. Click the *Actions* menu (*...*) and do one of the following for each transform, depending on the value in the *Status* column:
* `stopped`: Select *Start* to restart the transform. 
* `failed`: Select *Stop* to first stop the transform, and then select *Start* to restart it.

. On the confirmation message that displays, click *Start* to restart the transform.
. The transform’s status changes to `started`. Refresh the page if you don't see the change.
