If you encounter a `“Required transform failed”` notice on the Endpoints page, you can usually resolve the issue by restarting the transform. See {ref}/transforms.html[Transforming data] for more information about transforms.

To restart a transform that’s not running:

. Go to *Kibana* -> *Stack Management* -> *Data* -> *Transforms*.
. Enter `endpoint.metadata` in the search box to find the transforms for {endpoint-cloud-sec}.
. Click the *Actions* menu (*...*) and do one of the following for each transform, depending on the value in the *Status* column:
* `stopped`: Select *Start* to restart the transform. 
* `failed`: Select *Stop* to first stop the transform, and then select *Start* to restart it.
