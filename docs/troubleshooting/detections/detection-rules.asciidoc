[[IM-rule-failure]]
.Rules are failing due to number of alerts
[%collapsible]
====
If you receive the following rule failure: `"Bulk Indexing of signals failed: [parent] Data too large"`, this indicates that the alerts payload was too large to process.

This can be caused by bad indicator data, a misconfigured rule, or too many event matches. Review your indicator data or rule query. If nothing obvious is misconfigured, try executing the rule against a subset of the original data and continue diagnosis.
