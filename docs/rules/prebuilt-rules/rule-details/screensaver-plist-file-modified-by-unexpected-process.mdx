<div id="screensaver-plist-file-modified-by-unexpected-process"></div>

Identifies when a screensaver plist file is modified by an unexpected process. An adversary can maintain persistence on a macOS endpoint by creating a malicious screensaver (.saver) file and configuring the screensaver plist file to execute code each time the screensaver is activated.

## Investigation guide

```markdown
## Triage and analysis

- Analyze the plist file modification event to identify whether the change was expected or not
- Investigate the process that modified the plist file for malicious code or other suspicious behavior
- Identify if any suspicious or known malicious screensaver (.saver) files were recently written to or modified on the host
```

## Rule query

```js
file where host.os.type == "macos" and event.type != "deletion" and
  file.name: "com.apple.screensaver.*.plist" and
   file.path : (
      "/Users/*/Library/Preferences/ByHost/*",
      "/Library/Managed Preferences/*",
      "/System/Library/Preferences/*"
      ) and
  (
    process.code_signature.trusted == false or
    process.code_signature.exists == false or

    /* common script interpreters and abused native macOS bins */
    process.name : (
      "curl",
      "mktemp",
      "tail",
      "funzip",
      "python*",
      "osascript",
      "perl"
      )
   ) and

  /* Filter OS processes modifying screensaver plist files */
  not process.executable : (
    "/usr/sbin/cfprefsd",
    "/usr/libexec/xpcproxy",
    "/System/Library/CoreServices/ManagedClient.app/Contents/Resources/MCXCompositor",
    "/System/Library/CoreServices/ManagedClient.app/Contents/MacOS/ManagedClient"
    )
