<div id="potential-successful-linux-rdp-brute-force-attack-detected"></div>

An RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) brute force attack involves an attacker repeatedly attempting various username and password combinations to gain unauthorized access to a remote computer via RDP, and if successful, the potential impact can include unauthorized control over the compromised system, data theft, or the ability to launch further attacks within the network, jeopardizing the security and confidentiality of the targeted system and potentially compromising the entire network infrastructure. This rule identifies multiple consecutive authentication failures targeting a specific user account within a short time interval, followed by a successful authentication.

## Investigation guide

```markdown
## Setup
This rule requires the use of the `auditd_manager` integration. `Auditd_manager` is a tool designed to simplify and enhance the management of the audit subsystem in Linux systems. It provides a user-friendly interface and automation capabilities for configuring and monitoring system auditing through the auditd daemon. With `auditd_manager`, administrators can easily define audit rules, track system events, and generate comprehensive audit reports, improving overall security and compliance in the system. The following steps should be executed in order to install and deploy `auditd_manager` on a Linux system. 
```
Kibana -->
Management -->
Integrations -->
Auditd Manager -->
Add Auditd Manager
```
`Auditd_manager` subscribes to the kernel and receives events as they occur without any additional configuration. However, if more advanced configuration is required to detect specific behavior, audit rules can be added to the integration in either the "audit rules" configuration box or the "auditd rule files" box by specifying a file to read the audit rules from. 
```
For this detection rule no additional audit rules are required to be added to the integration. 
```
Add the newly installed `auditd manager` to an agent policy, and deploy the agent on a Linux system from which auditd log files are desirable.
```

## Rule query

```js
sequence by host.id, related.user with maxspan=5s
  [authentication where host.os.type == "linux" and event.dataset == "auditd_manager.auditd" and 
   event.action == "authenticated" and auditd.data.terminal : "*rdp*" and event.outcome == "failure"] with runs=10
  [authentication where host.os.type == "linux" and event.dataset == "auditd_manager.auditd" and 
   event.action  == "authenticated" and auditd.data.terminal : "*rdp*" and event.outcome == "success"] | tail 1
