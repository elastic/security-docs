= AI Assistant Knowledge Base

AI Assistant's Knowledge Base feature enables AI Assistant to recall specific documents and other specified information. This information, which can include everything from the location of your datacenters to the latest threat research, provides additional context that can improve the quality of AI Assistant's responses to your queries. This topic describes how to enable and add information to Knowledge Base.

NOTE: When you upgrade from {elastic-sec} version 8.15 to a newer version, information previously stored by AI Assistant will be lost.

[[enable-knowledge-base]]
== Enable Knowledge Base

There are two ways to enable Knowledge Base.

NOTE: You must individually enable Knowledge Base for each {kib} space where you want to use it.

[discrete]
=== Option 1: Enable Knowledge Base from an AI Assistant conversation

Open a conversation with AI Assistant, select a large language model, then click **Setup Knowledge Base**. If the button doesn't appear, Knowledge Base is already enabled.

image::images/knowledge-base-assistant-setup-button.png[An AI Assistant conversation showing the Setup Knowledge Base button]

Knowledge base setup may take several minutes. It will continue in the background if you close the conversation. After setup is complete, you can access Knowledge Base settings from AI Assistant's conversation settings menu (access the conversation settings menu by clicking the three dots button next to the model selection dropdown).

[[rag-for-alerts]]
== Knowledge base for alerts
When Knowledge Base is enabled, AI Assistant receives `open` or `acknowledged` alerts from your environment from the last 24 hours. It uses these as context for each of your prompts. This enables it to answer questions about multiple alerts in your environment rather than just about individual alerts you choose to send it. It receives alerts ordered by risk score, then by the most recently generated. Building block alerts are excluded. 

To enable Knowledge Base for alerts:

. Ensure that knowledge base is <<enable-knowledge-base, enabled>>.
. On the **Security AI settings** page, go to the **Knowledge Base** tab and use the slider to select the number of alerts to send to AI Assistant. Click **Save**.

NOTE: Including a large number of alerts may cause your request to exceed the maximum token length of your third-party generative AI provider. If this happens, try selecting a lower number of alerts to send.

[discrete]
[[knowledge-base-add-knowledge]]
== Add knowledge 

To view all knowledge base entries, go to **Security AI settings** and select the **Knowledge Base** tab. You can add individual documents or entire indices containing multiple documents. Each entry in the Knowledge Base (a document or index) has a **Sharing** setting of `private` or `global`. Private entries apply to the current user only and do not affect other users in the {kib} space, whereas global entries affect all users. Each entry can also have a `Required knowledge` setting, which means it will be included as context for every message sent to AI Assistant. 

NOTE: When you enable Knowledge Base, it comes pre-populated with articles from https://www.elastic.co/security-labs[Elastic Security Labs], current through September 30, 2024, which allows AI Assistant to leverage Elastic's security research during your conversations. This enables it to answer questions such as, “Are there any new tactics used against Windows hosts that I should be aware of when investigating my alerts?”

[discrete]
[[knowledge-base-add-knowledge-document]]
=== Add an individual document

Add an individual document to Knowledge Base when you want AI Assistant to remember a specific piece of information.

. To open **Security AI settings**, use the {kibana-ref}/introduction.html#kibana-navigation-search[global search field] to find "AI Assistant for Security." Select the **Knowledge Base** tab.
. Click **New → Document** and give it a name. 
. Under **Sharing**, select whether this knowledge should be **Global** or **Private**.
. Write the knowledge AI Assistant should remember in the **Markdown text** field.
. In the **Markdown text** field, enter the information you want AI Assistant to remember. 
. If it should be **Required knowledge**, select the option. Otherwise, leave it blank. 
Alternatively, you can simply send a message to AI Assistant that instructs it to "Remember" the information. For example, "Remember that I changed my password today, October 24, 2024", or "Remember we always use the Threat Hunting Timeline template when investigating potential threats". Entries created in this way are private to you. By default they are not required knowledge, but you can make them required by instructing AI Assistant to "Always remember", for example "Always remember to address me as madam", or "Always remember that our primary data center is located in Austin, Texas".

Refer to the following video for an example of adding a document to Knowledge Base from the settings menu.

[[knowledge-base-add-knowledge-index]]
=== Add an index

Add an index as a knowledge source when you want new information added to that index to automatically inform AI Assistant's responses. Common security examples include asset inventories, network configuration information, on-call matrices, threat intelligence reports, and vulnerability scans. 

IMPORTANT: Indices added to Knowledge Base must have at least one field mapped as {ref}/semantic-text.html[semantic text].

. To open **Security AI settings**, use the {kibana-ref}/introduction.html#kibana-navigation-search[global search field] to find "AI Assistant for Security." Select the **Knowledge Base** tab.
. Click **New → Index**.
. Name the knowledge source.
. Under **Sharing**, select whether this knowledge should be **Global** or **Private**.
. Under **Index**, enter the name of the index you want to use as a knowledge source.
. Under **Field**, enter the names of one or more semantic text fields within the index.
. Under **Data Description**, describe when this information should be used by AI Assistant.
. Under **Query Instruction**, describe how AI Assistant should query this index to retrieve relevant information.
. Under **Output Fields**, list the fields which should be sent to AI Assistant. If none are listed, all fields will be sent.

[[knowledge-base-crawler-or-connector]]
=== Add knowledge with a connector or web crawler

You can use an {es} connector or web crawler to create an index that contains data you want to add to Knowledge Base. 

This section provides an example of adding a threat intelligence feed to Knowledge Base using a web crawler. For more information on adding data to {es} using a connector, refer to {ref}/es-connectors.html[Ingest data with Elastic connectors]. For more information on web crawlers, refer to {enterprise-search-ref}/crawler.html[Elastic web crawler].

[discrete]
==== Use a web crawler to add threat intelligence to Knowledge Base

First, you'll need to set up a web crawler to add the desired data to an index, then you'll need to add that index to Knowledge Base.

. From the **Search** section of {kib}, find **Web crawlers** in the navigation menu or use the {kibana-ref}/introduction.html#kibana-navigation-search[global search field]. 
. Click **New web crawler**.
.. Under **Index name**, name the index where the data from your new web crawler will be stored, for example `threat_intelligence_feed_1`. Click **Create index**.
.. Under **Domain URL**, enter the URL where the web crawler should collect data. Click **Validate Domain** to test it, then **Add domain**. 
. The previous step opens a page with the details of your new index. Go to its **Mappings** tab, then click **Add field**.
+ 
NOTE: Remember, each index added to Knowledge Base must have at least one semantic text field.
+
.. Under **Field type**, select `Semantic text`. Under **Select an inference endpoint**, select `elastic-security-ai-assistant-elser2`. Click **Add field**, then **Save mapping**.
. Go to the **Scheduling** tab. Enable the **Enable recurring crawls with the following schedule** setting, and define your desired schedule.
. Go to the **Manage Domains** tab. Select the domain associated with your new web crawler, then go the its **Crawl rules** tab and click **Add crawl rule**. For more information, refer to {enterprise-search-ref}/crawler-extraction-rules.html[Web crawler content extraction rules].
.. Click **Add crawl rule** again. Under **Policy**, select `Disallow`. Under **Rule**, select `Regex`. Under **Path pattern**, enter `.*`. Click **Save**.
.. Under **Policy**, select `Allow`. Under **Rule**, select `Contains`. Under **Path pattern**, enter your path pattern, for example `threat-intelligence`. Click **Save**. Make sure this rule appears below the rule created in the previous step on the list.
.. Click **Crawl**, then **Crawl all domains on this index**. A success message appears. The crawl process will take longer for larger data sources. Once it finishes, your new web crawler's index will contain documents provided by the crawler.
. Finally, follow the instructions to <<knowledge-base-add-knowledge-index, add an index to Knowledge Base>>. Add the index that contains the data from your new web crawler (`threat_intelligence_feed_1` in this example).

Your new threat intelligence data is now included in Knowledge Base and can inform AI Assistant's responses.

Refer to the following video for an example of creating a web crawler to ingest threat intelligence data and adding it to Knowledge Base.
