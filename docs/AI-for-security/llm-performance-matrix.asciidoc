= Large language model performance matrix

This page describes the performance of various large language models (LLMs) for different use cases in {elastic-sec}, based on our internal testing. To learn more about these use cases, refer to <<attack-discovery, Attack discovery>> or <<security-assistant, AI Assistant>>. 

IMPORTANT: `Excellent` is the best rating, followed by `Great`, then by `Good`, and finally by `Poor`. Models rated `Excellent` or `Great` should produce quality results. Models rated `Good` or `Poor` are not recommended for that use case.
