= Detection Alerts Migration

After an upgrade of kibana, the latest Elastic Security features will be available for any new <<detection-alert-def, detection alerts>> that are generated. However, in order to enable new features on existing detection alerts, a migration may be necessary. See <<release-notes, Release Notes>> for instructions specific to your upgrade.

Migration of detection alerts is performed at the index level and is broken into three steps:

1. <<migration-1, Determining which indices to migrate>>
2. <<migration-2, Initiating migrations>>
3. <<migration-3, Finalizing migrations>>

[[migration-1]]
== Determining which indices to migrate
The Migration Status API can be used to determine which indices contain detection alerts of a particular age, along with migration info for each of those indices.

{
  "indices": [
    {
      "index": ".siem-signals-default-000002",

      "signal_versions": [
        {
          "version": 15,
          "count": 100
        },
        {

        }
      ],

        }
      ],
      "is_outdated": true
    },
    {
      "index": ".siem-signals-default-000003",
      "version": 16,
      "signal_versions": [
        {
          "version": 16,
          "count": 54
        }
      ],
      "migrations": [],
      "is_outdated": false
    }
  ]
}
--------------------------------------------------
The above response shows two indices: `.siem-signals-default-000002` is outdated, with multiple versions of detection alerts and a pending migration, and `.siem-signals-default-000003`, which is up to date as the current write index.

NOTE: indices that do not contain detection alerts in the specified range will be filtered from the response.

With the above info, we can compile a list of indices that we wish to migrate.

[[migration-2]]
== Initiating migrations

[[migration-3]]
== Finalizing migrations

[[migration-4]]
== Migration cleanup
