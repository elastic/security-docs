=== Microsoft Build Engine Started by an Office Application

An instance of MSBuild, the Microsoft Build Engine, was started by Excel or Word. This is unusual behavior for the Build Engine and could have been caused by an Excel or Word document executing a malicious script payload.

==== Potential false positives

The Build Engine is commonly used by Windows developers but use by non-engineers is unusual. It is quite unusual for this program to be started by an Office application like Word or Excel.

==== Investigation guide


[source,markdown]
----------------------------------
## Config

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

----------------------------------


==== Rule query


[source,js]
----------------------------------
process where event.type in ("start", "process_started") and
process.name : "MSBuild.exe" and process.parent.name :
("eqnedt32.exe", "excel.exe",
"fltldr.exe", "msaccess.exe",
"mspub.exe", "outlook.exe",
"powerpnt.exe", "winword.exe" )
