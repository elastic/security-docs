==== Potential false positives

Trail deletions may be made by a system or network administrator. Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment. Trail deletions by unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.
