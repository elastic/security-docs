=== Potential Credential Access via DuplicateHandle in LSASS

Identifies suspicious access to an LSASS handle via DuplicateHandle from an unknown call trace module. This may indicate an attempt to bypass the NtOpenProcess API to evade detection and dump LSASS memory for credential access.

==== Investigation guide


[source,markdown]
----------------------------------
## Config

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

----------------------------------


==== Rule query


[source,js]
----------------------------------
process where event.code == "10" and /* LSASS requesting
DuplicateHandle access right to another process */ process.name :
"lsass.exe" and winlog.event_data.GrantedAccess == "0x40" and /*
call is coming from an unknown executable region */
winlog.event_data.CallTrace : "*UNKNOWN*"
----------------------------------
