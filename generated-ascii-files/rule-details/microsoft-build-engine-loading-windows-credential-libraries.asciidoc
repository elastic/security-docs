==== Potential false positives

The Build Engine is commonly used by Windows developers but use by non-engineers is unusual.

==== Rule query


[source,js]
----------------------------------
sequence by process.entity_id [process where event.type == "start"
and (process.name : "MSBuild.exe" or process.pe.original_file_name ==
"MSBuild.exe")] [library where dll.name : ("vaultcli.dll",
"SAMLib.DLL")]
