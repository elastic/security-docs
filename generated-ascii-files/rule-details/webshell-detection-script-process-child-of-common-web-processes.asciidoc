==== Potential false positives

Security audits, maintenance, and network administrative scripts may trigger this alert when run under web processes.

==== Investigation guide


[source,markdown]
----------------------------------
## Triage and analysis

Detections should be investigated to identify if the activity corresponds to legitimate activity. As this rule detects post-exploitation process activity, investigations into this should be prioritized.

## Config

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

==== Rule query


[source,js]
----------------------------------
process where event.type == "start" and process.parent.name :
("w3wp.exe", "httpd.exe", "nginx.exe", "php.exe", "php-cgi.exe",
"tomcat.exe") and process.name : ("cmd.exe", "cscript.exe",
"powershell.exe", "pwsh.exe", "powershell_ise.exe", "wmic.exe",
"wscript.exe")
