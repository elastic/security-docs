==== Investigation guide

----------------------------------
## Triage and analysis

Verify process details such as command line and hash to confirm this activity legitimacy.

## Config

If enabling an EQL rule on a non-elastic-agent index (such as beats) for versions <8.2, events will not define `event.ingested` and default fallback for EQL rules was not added until 8.2, so you will need to add a custom pipeline to populate `event.ingested` to @timestamp for this rule to work.

==== Rule query


[source,js]
----------------------------------
file where event.type == "change" and file.name : "*AAA.AAA"
