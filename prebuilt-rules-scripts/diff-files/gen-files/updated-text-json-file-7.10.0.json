Is this activity\npart of an expected workflow for the user context? Examine the user identity in\nthe `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` field and the access key id in the\n`aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` field, which can help identify the\nprecise user context. The user agent details in the `user_agent.original` field\nmay also indicate what type of client made the request.\n* Consider the source IP address and geolocation for the calling user who\nissued the command. Do they look normal for the calling user? If the source is\nan EC2 IP address, is it associated with an EC2 instance in one of your\naccounts or could it be sourcing from an EC2 instance not under your control?\nIf it is an authorized EC2 instance, is the activity associated with normal\nbehavior for the instance role or roles?

If so, this can sometimes be a byproduct of discovery, privilege\nescalation or lateral movement attempts.\n* Consider the user as identified by the `user.name` field. Is this activity\npart of an expected workflow for the user context? Examine the user identity in\nthe `aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.arn` field and the access key id in the\n`aws.cloudtrail.user_identity.access_key_id` field which can help identify the\nprecise user context. The user agent details in the `user_agent.original` field\nmay also indicate what type of client made the request.\n* Consider the source IP address and geolocation for the calling user who\nissued the command.
